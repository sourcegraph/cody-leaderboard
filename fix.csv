The original code had a type mismatch - the function was declared to return a number, but the implementation returned the string '42' instead. This caused a diagnostic indicating that returning a string was not assignable to the declared return type of number.

The automated fix resolved this type mismatch by changing the returned value from the string '42' to the number 42. After this change, the function implementation matches the declared return type of number.

There are no remaining diagnostics after the fix, indicating that the type error was fully resolved. The code change itself is clean and appropriate - using the numeric value 42 instead of the string '42' is the correct way to resolve the return type mismatch.

The original code passed two string arguments '41' and '42' to the sum() function, which expects number arguments. This caused the diagnostic about an argument of type 'string' not being assignable to a parameter of type 'number'.

The automated fix changed the '41' and '42' arguments to be the number literals 41 and 42 instead. This resolves the original diagnostic.

The fix attempted to resolve this by changing the second argument from the string ""bananas is 42. I like the motorcycles honda and yamaha"" to the numeric literal 42. This matches the type expected by sum().

However, after the change, there is still a diagnostic complaining that ""Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Summer'."" It seems the sum() function expects a more specific numeric type called Summer, not just any number.

The fix did not fully resolve the type mismatch issue, it just changed the property name to something else that is also an invalid property. To fully fix this, the return type of the function would need to be changed to a type that has a 'spanishOmelette' (or 'spanishPotatoes') property, or the property being returned would need to changed to something that exists on the current return type.

The fix attempted to resolve this by changing the Timeouts property to an object with pollingThrottlePeriod and pollingTimeout properties, both set to 422.

This fix did address the original type mismatch diagnostic by providing an object for Timeouts instead of a number.

The fix was on the right track by changing Timeouts to an object, but it seems the specific properties used (pollingThrottlePeriod and pollingTimeout) do not match the expected properties of the TimeoutsConfig type. 

To fully resolve the issue, the fix should use the correct properties expected by the TimeoutsConfig type. Without knowing the exact definition of TimeoutsConfig, I can't say what those properties should be.

The original code passed a string as the second argument to the sum() function, which expected a numeric type, causing a type error diagnostic. 

The fix attempted to resolve this by changing the second argument from the string ""bananas is 42. I like the motorcycles honda and yamaha"" to the numeric literal 42. This matches the type expected by sum().

However, after the change, there is still a diagnostic complaining that ""Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Summer'."" It seems the sum() function expects a more specific numeric type called Summer, not just any number. 

So while the fix addressed the original type mismatch between string and number, it did not fully resolve the problem, as the supplied number is still not of the correct Summer type expected by sum(). The fix is incomplete.

The original code had an error because it was trying to access a property `spanishPotatoes` on the `foodie` object, but that property did not exist on the `Foodie` type.

The fix attempted to resolve this by spreading all the properties of `foodie` into a new object literal, and then adding the `spanishPotatoes` property with the value `foodie.tapas`. This fixes the original error by avoiding directly accessing `spanishPotatoes` on `foodie`.

However, the fix introduced a new error, because `tapas` is also not a valid property on the `Foodie` type. So while the original diagnostic was resolved, a new similar diagnostic appears after the fix.

The fix is heading in the right direction by avoiding the invalid property access, but it did not fully resolve the type mismatch between `Foodie` and `EnglishSpeakingFoodie`. To fully fix this, the return type of `example5` would need to be changed, or the object literal would need to be cast to `EnglishSpeakingFoodie`.

The fix attempted to resolve this by changing the Timeouts property to an object with pollingThrottlePeriod and pollingTimeout properties, both set to 422.

This fix did address the original type mismatch diagnostic by providing an object for Timeouts instead of a number. 

However, the fix introduced a new diagnostic, indicating that pollingThrottlePeriod is not a known property of the TimeoutsConfig type. So while the original diagnostic was fixed, the changes introduced a new issue.

The fix was on the right track by changing Timeouts to an object, but it seems the specific properties used (pollingThrottlePeriod and pollingTimeout) do not match the expected properties of the TimeoutsConfig type. 

To fully resolve the issue, the fix should use the correct properties expected by the TimeoutsConfig type. Without knowing the exact definition of TimeoutsConfig, I can't say what those properties should be.

So in summary, the fix resolved the original diagnostic but introduced a new one, indicating the changes were not a complete solution.

The original diagnostic was caused by assigning an empty value `{}` to the `languageKind` prop of the `Calculator` component. This is not allowed in JSX - props must be assigned a valid expression.

The automated fix attempted to resolve this by changing the prop assignment to `{lingua === 'japanese'}`. This does provide a valid boolean expression to the prop, which resolves the original diagnostic.

However, based on the new diagnostic after the fix, it seems that the `languageKind` prop is actually expecting a string value of either `""japanese""`, `""arabic""`, or `""roman""`, not a boolean. So while the original error is fixed, the change introduces a new type error.

To fully resolve the error, the fix should assign one of those valid string literals to the `languageKind` prop, based on the value of `lingua`. Something like:

```
<Calculator languageKind={lingua === 'japanese' ? 'japanese' : 'roman'} />
```

So in summary, the automated fix resolved the original diagnostic but introduced a new type error. The fix was in the right direction but did not fully account for the expected type of the `languageKind` prop.

This fix does resolve the original diagnostic about the missing argument. However, it introduces a new diagnostic saying the empty object is not assignable to the expected Config type, since it is missing required properties like RPID, RPDisplayName, and RPOrigins.

The original code was referencing an undefined variable `port` in the `RPOrigins` array, which caused the ""Cannot find name 'port'"" diagnostic.

The fix removed the reference to `port` and just hardcoded the localhost URL without a port number. This does resolve the original diagnostic, as `port` is no longer referenced.

However, hardcoding the URL like this makes the code less flexible. It would be better to keep the port number as a variable that can be easily changed.

The fix resolved the immediate diagnostic but the resulting code is not ideal. I would categorize this as an acceptable but not amazing fix.

The original diagnostic indicated that the value provided for the Timeouts property (422) was not assignable to the expected TimeoutsConfig type. 

The fix attempted to resolve this by changing the Timeouts property to an object with pollingThrottlePeriod and pollingTimeout properties, both set to 422.

This fix did address the original type mismatch diagnostic by providing an object for Timeouts instead of a number. 

However, the fix introduced a new diagnostic, indicating that pollingThrottlePeriod is not a known property of the TimeoutsConfig type. So while the original diagnostic was fixed, the changes introduced a new issue.

The fix was on the right track by changing Timeouts to an object, but it seems the specific properties used (pollingThrottlePeriod and pollingTimeout) do not match the expected properties of the TimeoutsConfig type. 

To fully resolve the issue, the fix should use the correct properties expected by the TimeoutsConfig type. Without knowing the exact definition of TimeoutsConfig, I can't say what those properties should be.

This fixed the original diagnostic, as languageKind is no longer an empty expression. However, it introduced a new diagnostic saying that ""typescript"" is not assignable to the type ""arabic"" | ""japanese"" | ""roman"". This suggests that the languageKind prop is an enum that only accepts one of those three string values, and ""typescript"" is not a valid value.

The original diagnostic was caused by assigning an empty value `{}` to the `languageKind` prop of the `Calculator` component. This is not allowed in JSX - props must be assigned a valid expression.

The automated fix attempted to resolve this by changing the prop assignment to `{lingua === 'japanese'}`. This does provide a valid boolean expression to the prop, which resolves the original diagnostic.

However, based on the new diagnostic after the fix, it seems that the `languageKind` prop is actually expecting a string value of either `""japanese""`, `""arabic""`, or `""roman""`, not a boolean. So while the original error is fixed, the change introduces a new type error.

To fully resolve the error, the fix should assign one of those valid string literals to the `languageKind` prop, based on the value of `lingua`. Something like:

```
<Calculator languageKind={lingua === 'japanese' ? 'japanese' : 'roman'} />
```

So in summary, the automated fix resolved the original diagnostic but introduced a new type error. The fix was in the right direction but did not fully account for the expected type of the `languageKind` prop.

The original diagnostic indicated that the makeWebAuthn() function expected 1 argument but was called with 0 arguments. The fix attempted to resolve this by passing an object literal with various configuration options as the argument.

This fix does resolve the original diagnostic, as makeWebAuthn() is now being called with 1 argument. However, it introduces a new diagnostic - 'timeout' is not a known property on the options object expected by makeWebAuthn(). The fix likely meant to use 'Timeout' instead.

Additionally, while passing configuration options is a valid fix, it's not clear if all of those options are actually necessary or if the default values would suffice. The fix could be more targeted.

  ",,[TS2304] Cannot find name 'port'.,1,"
The original code was referencing an undefined variable `port` in the `RPOrigins` array, which caused the ""Cannot find name 'port'"" diagnostic.

The fix removed the reference to `port` and just hardcoded the localhost URL without a port number. This does resolve the original diagnostic, as `port` is no longer referenced.

However, hardcoding the URL like this makes the code less flexible. It would be better to keep the port number as a variable that can be easily changed.

The fix resolved the immediate diagnostic but the resulting code is not ideal. I would categorize this as an acceptable but not amazing fix.

The original diagnostic indicated that the 'PID' property passed to makeWebAuthn() was invalid, and suggested using 'RPID' instead. The code fix correctly changed 'PID' to 'RPID' while keeping the value 'localhost' the same.

After the fix, there are no remaining diagnostics, indicating that the original error was fully resolved. The fix did not introduce any new issues.

The code change is very simple and targeted, only updating the one incorrect property name. It is a clean and appropriate fix for the reported diagnostic.

  ","[TS2353] Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'pollingThrottlePeriod' does not exist in type 'TimeoutsConfig'.",[TS2322] Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'TimeoutsConfig'.,1,"
The original diagnostic indicated that the value provided for the Timeouts property (422) was not assignable to the expected TimeoutsConfig type. 

The fix attempted to resolve this by changing the Timeouts property to an object with pollingThrottlePeriod and pollingTimeout properties, both set to 422.

This fix did address the original type mismatch diagnostic by providing an object for Timeouts instead of a number. 

However, the fix introduced a new diagnostic, indicating that pollingThrottlePeriod is not a known property of the TimeoutsConfig type. So while the original diagnostic was fixed, the changes introduced a new issue.

The fix was on the right track by changing Timeouts to an object, but it seems the specific properties used (pollingThrottlePeriod and pollingTimeout) do not match the expected properties of the TimeoutsConfig type. 

To fully resolve the issue, the fix should use the correct properties expected by the TimeoutsConfig type. Without knowing the exact definition of TimeoutsConfig, I can't say what those properties should be.

So in summary, the fix resolved the original diagnostic but introduced a new one, indicating the changes were not a complete solution.

The original diagnostic indicated that the Calculator component was being passed a ""language"" prop, but the CalculatorProps type did not include a ""language"" property. 

The automated fix changed the prop name from ""language"" to ""languageKind"" in the example15 function where the Calculator component is used. This matches the ""languageKind"" prop that is expected by the CalculatorProps type, based on the Calculator component definition.

After the fix, there are no remaining diagnostics, indicating the original type error was resolved.

The fix fully resolved the diagnostic by aligning the prop name with what was expected by the props type. The code changes were minimal and appropriate to resolve the issue. No new issues or inelegant code were introduced.

The original diagnostic indicated that the JSX attribute languageKind was being assigned an empty expression, which is invalid. The fix attempted to resolve this by assigning the string literal ""typescript"" to languageKind.

This fixed the original diagnostic, as languageKind is no longer an empty expression. However, it introduced a new diagnostic saying that ""typescript"" is not assignable to the type ""arabic"" | ""japanese"" | ""roman"". This suggests that the languageKind prop is an enum that only accepts one of those three string values, and ""typescript"" is not a valid value.

So while the fix resolved the original error, it introduced a new type error by providing an invalid value for that prop. The fix is incomplete, as it should have assigned one of the allowed enum values instead of ""typescript"".

  ","[TS2322] Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type '""japanese"" | ""arabic"" | ""roman""'.",[TS17000] JSX attributes must only be assigned a non-empty 'expression'.,1,"
The original diagnostic was caused by assigning an empty value `{}` to the `languageKind` prop of the `Calculator` component. This is not allowed in JSX - props must be assigned a valid expression.

The automated fix attempted to resolve this by changing the prop assignment to `{lingua === 'japanese'}`. This does provide a valid boolean expression to the prop, which resolves the original diagnostic.

However, based on the new diagnostic after the fix, it seems that the `languageKind` prop is actually expecting a string value of either `""japanese""`, `""arabic""`, or `""roman""`, not a boolean. So while the original error is fixed, the change introduces a new type error.

To fully resolve the error, the fix should assign one of those valid string literals to the `languageKind` prop, based on the value of `lingua`. Something like:

```
<Calculator languageKind={lingua === 'japanese' ? 'japanese' : 'roman'} />
```

So in summary, the automated fix resolved the original diagnostic but introduced a new type error. The fix was in the right direction but did not fully account for the expected type of the `languageKind` prop.
