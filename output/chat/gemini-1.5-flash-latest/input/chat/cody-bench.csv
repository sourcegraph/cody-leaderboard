They provide a dynamic, efficient way to work with collections of elements. Here's a breakdown of how they work:

**1. Underlying Arrays:**

   - Slices are built on top of arrays. They are essentially a view or reference to a contiguous block of memory that holds the underlying array.
   - When you create a slice, you're not copying the entire array; you're creating a descriptor that points to a portion of the array.

**2. Slice Structure:**

   - A slice has three components:
      - **Pointer:** Points to the first element of the underlying array.
      - **Length:** The number of elements in the slice.
      - **Capacity:** The total size of the underlying array.

**3. Creating Slices:**

   - **Literal Syntax:**
     ```go
     numbers := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
     ```
   - **Make Function:**
     ```go
     names := make([]string, 5) // Creates a slice with length 5 and capacity 5
     ```
   - **From Existing Arrays:**
     ```go
     arr := [5]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
     slice := arr[1:3] // Creates a slice from the 2nd to 3rd element of the array
     ```

**4. Slice Operations:**

   - **Accessing Elements:**
     ```go
     names[0] = ""Alice""
     fmt.Println(numbers[2]) // Output: 3
     ```
   - **Slicing:**
     ```go
     evenNumbers := numbers[1:4] // Creates a new slice with elements from index 1 to 3 (exclusive)
     ```
   - **Appending:**
     ```go
     names = append(names, ""Bob"") // Adds ""Bob"" to the end of the slice
     ```
   - **Deleting:**
     ```go
     names = append(names[:2], names[3:]...) // Removes the element at index 2
     ```
   - **Iterating:**
     ```go
     for i, name := range names {
         fmt.Printf(""Index: %d, Name: %s\n"", i, name)
     }
     ```

**5. Capacity and Growth:**

   - When you append to a slice, if its capacity is exceeded, Go will automatically create a new, larger underlying array and copy the existing elements.
   - The new array's capacity is typically doubled, ensuring efficient growth.

**6. Passing Slices:**

   - Slices are passed by reference, meaning changes made to a slice within a function will affect the original slice.

**7. Multi-Dimensional Slices:**

   - You can create multi-dimensional slices to represent matrices or other data structures.
     ```go
     matrix := [][]int{
         {1, 2, 3},
         {4, 5, 6},
     }
     ```

**Key Points:**

   - Slices are dynamic and can grow or shrink as needed.
   - They are efficient for working with collections of data.
   - They are passed by reference, so changes made to a slice within a function affect the original slice.
   - Slices are a powerful and fundamental data structure in Go.

1. **Initialization:** The `Agent` is initialized with a `Searcher` and a `Ranker`. The `Searcher` handles the actual search process, retrieving results from the index. The `Ranker` is responsible for scoring and ranking the retrieved results.

2. **Search Execution:** When a search query is received, the `Agent` delegates the search to the `Searcher`. The `Searcher` returns a list of `Result` objects, each representing a potential match.

3. **Ranking:** The `Agent` then passes the `Result` objects to the `Ranker`. The `Ranker` applies various ranking algorithms to score each result based on factors like relevance, file type, code context, and other criteria.

**1. Lightweight Threads**

* Goroutines are lightweight, concurrent execution units managed by the Go runtime. They are not operating system threads, but rather user-level threads.
* This means they are much cheaper to create and manage than traditional threads, allowing Go programs to handle a massive number of concurrent tasks.

**2. The Go Scheduler**

* The Go runtime has a scheduler that manages the execution of goroutines. It distributes goroutines across available operating system threads.
* The scheduler uses a work-stealing algorithm, where idle threads ""steal"" work from busy threads, ensuring efficient utilization of CPU resources.

**3. Channels for Communication**

* Goroutines communicate with each other using channels. Channels are typed communication conduits that allow goroutines to send and receive data.
* This communication is synchronized, ensuring data integrity and preventing race conditions.

**4. The `go` Keyword**

* You create a goroutine by using the `go` keyword before a function call. For example:

```go
go func() {
    // Code to be executed concurrently
}()
```

**5. Example: Concurrent Calculation**

```go
package main

import (
    ""fmt""
    ""time""
)

func calculate(n int) int {
    time.Sleep(1 * time.Second) // Simulate work
    return n * 2
}

func main() {
    go calculate(10) // Start a goroutine
    go calculate(20) // Start another goroutine

    time.Sleep(3 * time.Second) // Wait for goroutines to finish
    fmt.Println(""Done!"")
}
```

**Key Points:**

* **Concurrency, not parallelism:** Goroutines enable concurrent execution, but the actual parallelism depends on the number of available CPU cores.
* **Lightweight and efficient:** Goroutines are incredibly lightweight, making them ideal for handling many concurrent tasks.
* **Channel-based communication:** Channels provide a safe and efficient way for goroutines to communicate and synchronize.
* **Simplified concurrency:** Go's goroutines and channels make it easier to write concurrent programs compared to traditional threading models.
