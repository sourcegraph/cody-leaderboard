# CHAT_QUESTION What does this repo do??

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the code you provided, this repository appears to be part of a code search engine called **Zoekt**. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Here's why:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **Package Name:** The code is in a package named `zoekt`, suggesting it's part of a larger project with that name.
# CHAT_REPLY * **FileMatch Structure:** The code deals with `FileMatch` structs, which likely represent matches found during a search. These structs contain information about `ChunkMatches` and `LineMatches`, indicating that the search results are presented at the level of code chunks and lines.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Search Options:** The code references a `SearchOptions` struct, which suggests that the search engine allows users to configure various search parameters.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Display Truncation:** The `DisplayTruncator` function and its related code are responsible for limiting the number of search results displayed to the user, likely to prevent overwhelming them with too much information.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY **In summary:** The code you provided appears to be part of a code search engine that allows users to search for code snippets and then displays the results in a truncated and organized manner.
