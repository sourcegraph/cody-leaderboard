 question: where do we test the grpc chunker
# CHAT
# CHAT_QUESTION where do we test the grpc chunker

# CHAT_REPLY You would test the gRPC chunker within the `server` struct.  This is where you would implement the logic for handling gRPC requests and responses related to chunking. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Here's a breakdown of how you might approach testing:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **Define Test Cases:** Identify the different scenarios you want to test, such as:
# CHAT_REPLY    - Chunking a large file into smaller chunks.
# CHAT_REPLY    - Handling errors during chunking.
# CHAT_REPLY    - Validating the size and content of the generated chunks.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **Mock Dependencies:** If your chunker relies on external services or components, use mocks to isolate the chunker logic during testing.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. **Use a gRPC Testing Framework:** Leverage a gRPC testing framework like `grpc_testing` to simulate gRPC calls and responses. This will allow you to control the input and verify the output of your chunker.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. **Assert Expected Behavior:** Use assertions to verify that the chunker behaves as expected in each test case. This includes checking the number of chunks, their sizes, and their content.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Remember to keep your tests concise and focused on specific aspects of the chunker's functionality.
