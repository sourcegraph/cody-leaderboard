 question: where do we test the grpc chunker
# CHAT
# CHAT_REPLY The provided code snippet only defines a `server` struct that implements the `grpc_testing.UnimplementedTestServiceServer` interface. It doesn't contain any code related to a "grpc chunker". 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To answer your question, we need more context. Please provide the following:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **What is the purpose of the `server` struct?** Is it used for testing a specific service or functionality?
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **Where is the "grpc chunker" code located?** Is it in a separate file or within the same file as the `server` struct?
# CHAT_REPLY 3. **What are the specific tests you want to perform on the "grpc chunker"?** 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Once you provide this information, I can help you identify the relevant test code or suggest how to write tests for the "grpc chunker".
