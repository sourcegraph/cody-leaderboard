 question: where do we test the grpc chunker

# CHAT_QUESTION where do we test the grpc chunker

# CHAT_REPLY The provided code snippet is a very basic server implementation for gRPC testing. It doesn't contain any chunking logic. To find where the gRPC chunker is tested, you'll need to look for:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **Test files:** Search for files named `*_test.go` or similar that contain the word "chunker" in their name.
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **Test functions:** Look for functions with names like `TestChunker`, `TestGrpcChunker`, or similar that test chunking functionality.
# CHAT_REPLY 3. **Test cases:** Within test functions, look for specific test cases that involve chunking.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Without more context or code, it's impossible to pinpoint the exact location of the gRPC chunker tests.
