 question: where do we test the grpc chunker

# CHAT_QUESTION where do we test the grpc chunker

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided code snippet, it seems like the `server` struct is a basic implementation of a gRPC server. However, there's no direct indication of a "chunker" being tested within this code. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To answer your question accurately, I need more context. Please provide the following:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **The full file:**  The code snippet you provided is just a single line.  To understand the context of the `server` struct and how it relates to a "chunker," I need the entire file.
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **The definition of "chunker":** What exactly is a "chunker" in this codebase? Is it a function, a struct, or a specific part of the gRPC server? 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. **Any other relevant files:**  Are there other files in the codebase that might contain tests related to the "chunker"? 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Once I have this information, I can help you pinpoint where the gRPC chunker is being tested.
