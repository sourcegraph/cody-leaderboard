 question: explain @README.md
# CHAT
# CHAT_REPLY The `@sourcegraph/cody-agent` package is a JSON-RPC server that allows non-ECMAScript clients to interact with Cody. This means that clients written in languages other than JavaScript, such as those used in JetBrains and NeoVim plugins, can communicate with Cody using this package.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The package uses standard input (stdin) and standard output (stdout) for communication. This allows it to be integrated into various environments and applications without requiring specific network configurations.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY In summary, the `@sourcegraph/cody-agent` package provides a bridge between Cody and non-JavaScript clients, enabling them to leverage Cody's capabilities for tasks like code completion, documentation generation, and more.
