# CHAT_QUESTION \@zoekt describe my code.

# CHAT_REPLY The codebase you provided is a Go package called `agent` that implements a JSON-RPC server for interacting with Cody via stdout/stdin. This package is designed for non-ECMAScript clients, such as the JetBrains and NeoVim plugins.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The codebase defines the following key components:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **RateLimit:** This struct represents a rate limit configuration for Cody requests. It includes properties like allowed models, limit, interval, and concurrent requests.
# CHAT_REPLY * **concurrencyLimiter:** This struct implements a concurrency limiter that ensures a certain number of concurrent requests are not exceeded. It uses a Redis store to track usage and enforce the limit.
# CHAT_REPLY * **ErrConcurrencyLimitExceeded:** This error type is returned when the concurrency limit is exceeded. It provides information about the limit, the feature being used, and the time to retry.
# CHAT_REPLY * **updateOnErrorLimiter:** This struct wraps a limiter and attempts to update the actor's access information if a rate limit or access error occurs.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The codebase also includes functions for creating rate limits, evaluating allowed models, and handling concurrency limits. It also provides utilities for writing error responses to HTTP clients.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Overall, the codebase provides a robust mechanism for managing rate limits and concurrency for Cody requests, ensuring a fair and efficient use of the service.
