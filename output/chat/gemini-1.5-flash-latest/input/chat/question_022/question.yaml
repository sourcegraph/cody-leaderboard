# CHAT_QUESTION what does @limit.go do?

# CHAT_REPLY The `limit.go` file in this codebase defines functions for limiting the number of search results displayed to the user. It implements two main concepts:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **Display Truncation:** This is achieved through the `DisplayTruncator` function type. It takes a slice of `FileMatch` (representing search results) and applies limits based on the provided `SearchOptions`. This ensures that the user doesn't get overwhelmed with too many results.
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **Match Limiting:** This involves limiting the number of matches within each `FileMatch`. This is done by the `limitMatches` function, which calls either `limitChunkMatches` or `limitLineMatches` depending on the search options.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Here's a breakdown of the key functions:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **`SortAndTruncateFiles`:** This function sorts the search results and then applies the `DisplayTruncator` to limit the number of files and matches displayed.
# CHAT_REPLY * **`NewDisplayTruncator`:** This function creates a `DisplayTruncator` based on the limits specified in the `SearchOptions`. It handles both document and match limits.
# CHAT_REPLY * **`limitMatches`:** This function iterates through the `FileMatch` slice and calls either `limitChunkMatches` or `limitLineMatches` to limit the number of matches within each file.
# CHAT_REPLY * **`limitChunkMatches`:** This function limits the number of `ChunkMatches` within a `FileMatch`. It also truncates the `Content` field to match the new range of `ChunkMatches`.
# CHAT_REPLY * **`limitLineMatches`:** This function limits the number of `LineMatches` within a `FileMatch`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY In essence, `limit.go` ensures that the search results are presented in a manageable way, preventing the user from being bombarded with too much information. It provides a mechanism to control the display of search results based on user-defined limits.
