# CHAT_QUESTION what does @limit.go do?

# CHAT_REPLY The `limit.go` file defines functions that handle limiting the number of displayed results in a search. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Here's a breakdown of its key components:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **`SortAndTruncateFiles`:** This function sorts the search results (`FileMatch` objects) and then applies truncation based on the search options. It uses the `DisplayTruncator` function to enforce the limits.
# CHAT_REPLY * **`DisplayTruncator`:** This is a function type that takes a slice of `FileMatch` objects and returns a truncated slice along with a boolean indicating whether there are more results to be displayed.
# CHAT_REPLY * **`NewDisplayTruncator`:** This function creates a `DisplayTruncator` based on the search options. It checks for limits on the number of documents and matches to be displayed. If there are no limits, it returns a function that simply returns the input slice.
# CHAT_REPLY * **`limitMatches`:** This function limits the number of matches within each `FileMatch` object. It uses either `limitChunkMatches` or `limitLineMatches` depending on whether the search is for chunk matches or line matches.
# CHAT_REPLY * **`limitChunkMatches`:** This function limits the number of `ChunkMatches` within a `FileMatch`. It truncates the `Ranges`, `SymbolInfo`, and `Content` fields of the `ChunkMatch` objects to ensure consistency.
# CHAT_REPLY * **`limitLineMatches`:** This function limits the number of `LineMatches` within a `FileMatch`. It simply truncates the `LineFragments` field of the `LineMatch` objects.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY In essence, `limit.go` implements the logic for displaying a limited number of search results to the user, ensuring that the results are not overwhelming and that the user can easily navigate through them.
