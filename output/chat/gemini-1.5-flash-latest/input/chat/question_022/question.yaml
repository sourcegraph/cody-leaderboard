# CHAT_QUESTION what does @limit.go do?

# CHAT_REPLY The `limit.go` file implements functionality to limit the number of files, matches, and content displayed in search results. It provides two main functions:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **`SortAndTruncateFiles`:** This function sorts the search results (`FileMatch` objects) and then applies truncation based on the search options. It uses a `DisplayTruncator` function to enforce limits on the number of files and matches displayed.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **`NewDisplayTruncator`:** This function creates a `DisplayTruncator` function based on the search options. It checks if there are any limits defined in the options (e.g., `MaxDocDisplayCount`, `MaxMatchDisplayCount`). If there are no limits, it returns a function that simply returns the input file matches without any modification. Otherwise, it returns a function that enforces the limits by truncating the file matches and content.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The `DisplayTruncator` function is responsible for:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY - Limiting the number of files displayed based on `MaxDocDisplayCount`.
# CHAT_REPLY - Limiting the number of matches displayed per file based on `MaxMatchDisplayCount`.
# CHAT_REPLY - Truncating the content of each match to fit within the specified limits.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The file also includes helper functions like `limitMatches`, `limitChunkMatches`, and `limitLineMatches` to handle the specific truncation logic for different types of matches (chunk matches and line matches).
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY In summary, `limit.go` ensures that the search results are displayed in a manageable and efficient way by limiting the number of files, matches, and content shown to the user. This helps to prevent overwhelming the user with too much information and improves the overall performance of the search system.
