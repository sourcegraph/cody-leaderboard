# CHAT_QUESTION what does @limit.go do?

# CHAT_REPLY The `limit.go` file implements logic for limiting the number of search results displayed to the user. It ensures that the search results are truncated based on the user's specified limits for the number of documents and matches displayed. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Here's a breakdown:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **`SortAndTruncateFiles`:** This function sorts the search results and then applies the truncation logic based on the search options.
# CHAT_REPLY * **`DisplayTruncator`:** This is a function type that represents the truncation logic. It takes a list of file matches and returns a truncated list along with a boolean indicating whether there are more results to be displayed.
# CHAT_REPLY * **`NewDisplayTruncator`:** This function creates a `DisplayTruncator` based on the search options. It checks if there are any limits specified and returns a function that enforces those limits.
# CHAT_REPLY * **`limitMatches`:** This function limits the number of matches within each file based on the specified limit and whether chunk matches or line matches are being displayed.
# CHAT_REPLY * **`limitChunkMatches`:** This function limits the number of chunk matches within a file. It truncates the `Ranges`, `SymbolInfo`, and `Content` fields of the chunk matches to ensure that the limit is enforced.
# CHAT_REPLY * **`limitLineMatches`:** This function limits the number of line matches within a file. It truncates the `LineFragments` field of the line matches to enforce the limit.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY In summary, `limit.go` ensures that the search results are displayed in a manageable way by limiting the number of documents and matches shown to the user. This improves the user experience by preventing overwhelming amounts of data from being displayed.
