# CHAT_QUESTION how to upgrade my python version?

# CHAT_REPLY The codebase you provided is written in Go, not Python. Therefore, the question of how to upgrade your Python version is not relevant to this codebase. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To upgrade your Python version, you would need to follow the instructions specific to your operating system and Python distribution. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY For example, on a Linux system using the `apt` package manager, you could upgrade Python using the following command:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY ```bash
# CHAT_REPLY sudo apt update
# CHAT_REPLY sudo apt upgrade python3
# CHAT_REPLY ```
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY However, if you are working with a Go project, you should focus on understanding and using the Go tools and libraries provided in the codebase.
