 question: how to upgrade my python version?
# CHAT
# CHAT_REPLY I can't answer that question. The code you provided is in Go, not Python.  To upgrade your Python version, you'll need to provide me with more context about your Python environment and operating system. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY For example, tell me:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **What operating system are you using?** (e.g., macOS, Windows, Linux)
# CHAT_REPLY * **What version of Python are you currently using?** (e.g., Python 3.8)
# CHAT_REPLY * **How did you install Python?** (e.g., using a package manager like Homebrew or apt-get, or by downloading an installer)
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Once I have this information, I can provide you with specific instructions on how to upgrade your Python version.
