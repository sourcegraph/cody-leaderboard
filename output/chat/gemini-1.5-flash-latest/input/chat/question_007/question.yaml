# CHAT_QUESTION how to upgrade my python version?

# CHAT_REPLY The codebase you provided is written in Go, not Python.  Therefore, the question of how to upgrade your Python version is not relevant to this codebase. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you're looking to upgrade your Python version, you'll need to provide more context about your specific environment and operating system. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY For example, you could tell me:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **What operating system are you using?** (e.g., macOS, Windows, Linux)
# CHAT_REPLY * **What version of Python are you currently using?**
# CHAT_REPLY * **What version of Python do you want to upgrade to?**
# CHAT_REPLY * **Are you using a virtual environment?**
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Once I have this information, I can provide you with specific instructions on how to upgrade your Python version.
