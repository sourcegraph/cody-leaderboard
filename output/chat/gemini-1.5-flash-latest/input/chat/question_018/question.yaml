# CHAT_QUESTION See zoekt repo find location of tensor function

# CHAT_REPLY The provided codebase context doesn't contain a function named "tensor".  It's likely that the function you're looking for is in a different part of the Zoekt repository. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To find the location of the "tensor" function, you could try the following:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **Search the entire repository:** Use your IDE's search functionality or a command-line tool like `grep` to search for the function name "tensor" across all files in the repository.
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **Look in related files:** If you know the general purpose of the "tensor" function, try searching for related terms or concepts in the codebase. For example, if it's related to machine learning, you might search for terms like "neural network," "embedding," or "vector."
# CHAT_REPLY 3. **Check the documentation:** If the Zoekt repository has documentation, it might contain information about the "tensor" function and its location.
# CHAT_REPLY 4. **Use a code search engine:** Websites like Sourcegraph or GitHub's code search can help you find the function across multiple repositories.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Let me know if you have any other information about the "tensor" function, such as its purpose or the file it might be in, and I'll do my best to help you find it.
