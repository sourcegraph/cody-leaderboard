# CHAT
# CHAT_REPLY I can't directly access the "zoekt repo" or any external codebases. My knowledge is limited to the code snippet you provided. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To find the location of a "tensor" function, I need more information:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **Which repository is "zoekt"?**  Is it a specific GitHub repository, or a local project?
# CHAT_REPLY * **What is the "tensor" function?** Is it a specific function name, or a function with a similar purpose?
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Once you provide this information, I can help you find the location of the function.
