# CHAT_QUESTION See zoekt repo find location of tensor function

# CHAT_REPLY The provided codebase context does not contain any function named "tensor". 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY It seems you are looking for a function that might be related to tensor operations, but it's not present in the given code. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To help me find the location of the "tensor" function, please provide more context:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **What is the purpose of the "tensor" function?** What kind of operations does it perform?
# CHAT_REPLY * **What is the specific codebase you are referring to?**  Is it a different part of the Zoekt repository or a different project entirely?
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY With more information, I can assist you in finding the location of the "tensor" function.
