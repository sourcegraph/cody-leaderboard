# CHAT_QUESTION See zoekt repo find location of tensor function

# CHAT_REPLY I can't help you with that. I don't have access to the "zoekt" repository or any information about its codebase. I can only access the code you provided in the `mocked_context/watcher.go` file. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To find the location of the "tensor" function in the zoekt repository, you'll need to:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **Access the zoekt repository:** You can find it on GitHub or wherever it's hosted.
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **Search the codebase:** Use the repository's search functionality or a code editor with search capabilities to find the function definition. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Let me know if you have any other questions about the code in `mocked_context/watcher.go`.
