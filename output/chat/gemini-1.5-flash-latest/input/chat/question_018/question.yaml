# CHAT_REPLY The provided codebase context doesn't contain any function named "tensor". It's likely that this function is not part of the Zoekt repository. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To find the location of the "tensor" function, you'll need to provide more context:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **What repository are you looking for the function in?**  Is it a different repository than the one provided?
# CHAT_REPLY * **What is the purpose of the "tensor" function?**  Knowing its purpose might help narrow down the search.
