# CHAT_QUESTION See zoekt repo find location of tensor function

# CHAT_REPLY The `tensor` function is not present in the Zoekt codebase. It's likely a function from a different library or project. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To find the location of the `tensor` function, you'll need to:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **Identify the library or project where it's defined:**  Look for import statements in your code that might be related to tensors or machine learning.
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **Search the library's documentation:** Once you know the library, consult its documentation or API reference to find the `tensor` function.
# CHAT_REPLY 3. **Use a code search engine:** If you're unsure about the library, you can use a code search engine like Sourcegraph to search for the `tensor` function across various repositories. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Let me know if you have more information about the code where you encountered the `tensor` function, and I can help you narrow down the search.
