# CHAT_QUESTION What does directory watcher do?

# CHAT_REPLY The `DirectoryWatcher` in the provided codebase is responsible for monitoring a directory containing Zoekt shard files. It performs the following actions:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **Scanning:** It scans the directory for shard files (`.zoekt` files) and their associated metadata files (`.zoekt.meta`). It keeps track of the modification times of these files.
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **Loading:** It loads new shard files that have been added or modified since the last scan. It also unloads shard files that have been deleted.
# CHAT_REPLY 3. **Watching:** It uses `fsnotify` to watch for changes (creation, modification, deletion) in the directory. When a change is detected, it triggers a new scan.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The `DirectoryWatcher` works in conjunction with a `shardLoader` interface, which is responsible for actually loading and unloading the shard files. This allows the `DirectoryWatcher` to focus on monitoring the directory and triggering updates, while the actual loading and unloading logic is handled by the `shardLoader`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY In summary, the `DirectoryWatcher` ensures that the Zoekt index is kept up-to-date by monitoring the shard directory and loading/unloading shard files as needed.
