# CHAT_QUESTION What does directory watcher do?

# CHAT_REPLY The provided codebase context doesn't contain any information about a "directory watcher".  It's likely that this functionality is implemented in a different part of the codebase, or perhaps in a separate package. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To understand what a directory watcher does, we need to look at its purpose:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **Monitoring Changes:** Directory watchers are used to monitor a specific directory for changes, such as the creation, modification, or deletion of files or subdirectories.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Triggering Actions:** When a change is detected, the directory watcher can trigger a specific action, such as:
# CHAT_REPLY     * **Re-indexing:**  In the context of a search engine like Zoekt, a directory watcher might be used to re-index files when they are modified, ensuring the search index is up-to-date.
# CHAT_REPLY     * **Notifications:**  A directory watcher could be used to send notifications about changes to users or other systems.
# CHAT_REPLY     * **Running Scripts:**  It could trigger the execution of scripts or other programs in response to changes.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY **To find out how a directory watcher is implemented in this codebase, you would need to search for:**
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **File system monitoring libraries:** Look for imports of libraries like `fsnotify` (Go) or `chokidar` (Node.js) that provide file system monitoring capabilities.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Event handlers:** Search for code that registers event handlers for file system events (e.g., `Create`, `Modify`, `Delete`).
# CHAT_REPLY * **Logic for triggering actions:** Look for code that defines the actions to be taken when a file system event is detected.
