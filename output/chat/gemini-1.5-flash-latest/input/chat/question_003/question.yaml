# CHAT_QUESTION What code do you have access to?

# CHAT_REPLY I have access to the codebase context provided in the `README.md` file. This file describes the Zoekt project, a fast text search engine for source code. It outlines the following:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **Project Overview:** The purpose and origin of Zoekt, its relationship to Sourcegraph and Google's original project.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Installation:** Instructions on downloading, indexing, and searching using Zoekt.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Search Service:** Information about the `zoekt-indexserver` command and its configuration for mirroring and indexing repositories.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Symbol Search:** Recommendations for using Universal ctags to improve search ranking.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Acknowledgements:** Credits to the creators and contributors of Zoekt.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Fork Details:** A historical section explaining the differences between the Sourcegraph fork and the original Google project.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Disclaimer:** A statement that Zoekt is not an official Google product.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY While the `README.md` file provides a comprehensive overview of the project, it does not contain any actual code. It primarily focuses on documentation and instructions for using Zoekt. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To access the actual code, you would need to explore the repository itself, which is likely located at `github.com/sourcegraph/zoekt`.
