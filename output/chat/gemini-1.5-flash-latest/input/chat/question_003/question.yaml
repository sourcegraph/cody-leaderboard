# CHAT_QUESTION What code do you have access to?

# CHAT_REPLY I have access to the codebase context provided in the `README.md` file. This includes:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **Instructions for downloading, indexing, searching, and installing Zoekt:** This covers commands for indexing directories, Git repositories, and Repo repositories, as well as searching using the web interface, JSON API, and CLI.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Information about the Zoekt search service:** This includes details on how to use `zoekt-indexserver` to mirror and index repositories.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Details on symbol search:** This mentions the use of Universal ctags for improved ranking.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Acknowledgements and fork details:** This provides information about the origin of the fork and its differences from the original Google Zoekt.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Disclaimer:** This clarifies that the codebase is not an official Google product.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY However, I do **not** have access to the actual source code of Zoekt itself. The `README.md` file only provides instructions and information about the project, not the code itself.
