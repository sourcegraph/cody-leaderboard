# CHAT_QUESTION What code do you have access to?

# CHAT_REPLY I have access to the `README.md` file from the `mocked/codebase_context` directory. This file provides information about Zoekt, a fast text search engine for source code. It includes instructions on downloading, indexing, searching, and installing Zoekt. It also mentions a service management program, symbol search, and acknowledges the original creators of Zoekt. Finally, it details the differences between this fork and the original Google Zoekt repository.
