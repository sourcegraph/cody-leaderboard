# CHAT_QUESTION Is my codebase clean?

# CHAT_REPLY I can't tell you if your codebase is "clean" without more information. "Clean" is a subjective term and depends on what you consider important. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To help me assess your codebase, please tell me:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **What are your specific concerns about the codebase's cleanliness?** Are you worried about code style, code complexity, code duplication, or something else?
# CHAT_REPLY * **What are your goals for the codebase?** Are you aiming for maintainability, performance, security, or something else?
# CHAT_REPLY * **What tools or metrics do you use to assess code quality?** Do you use linters, code complexity analyzers, or other tools?
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Once I have a better understanding of your needs, I can provide more specific feedback on whether your codebase is "clean" according to your criteria.
