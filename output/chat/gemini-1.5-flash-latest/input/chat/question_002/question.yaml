# CHAT_QUESTION what is squirrel?

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided code, `Squirrel` is a code intelligence API. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Here's what we know:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **Interface:** The code defines an interface called `Squirrel`. This means it outlines the structure and methods that any object implementing the `Squirrel` interface must have.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Method:** The `Squirrel` interface has a single method called `symbolInformation`. This method takes a file path as input and returns a `CodeIntelligence` object.
# CHAT_REPLY * **CodeIntelligence:** The `CodeIntelligence` interface is not fully defined in the provided code, but it likely represents information about symbols within a file.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Therefore, we can conclude that `Squirrel` is an API that provides code intelligence features, specifically the ability to retrieve symbol information from a given file.
