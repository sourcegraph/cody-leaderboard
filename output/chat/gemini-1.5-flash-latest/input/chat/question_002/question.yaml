# CHAT_QUESTION what is squirrel?

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided code, `Squirrel` is a code intelligence API. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Here's what we can tell from the code:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **Interface:** The code defines an interface named `Squirrel`. This means it outlines the structure and methods that any object implementing this interface must have.
# CHAT_REPLY * **`symbolInformation` method:** The `Squirrel` interface has a method called `symbolInformation` that takes a file path as input and returns a `CodeIntelligence` object. This suggests that `Squirrel` is capable of providing information about symbols (like variables, functions, classes) within a given file.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Therefore, we can conclude that `Squirrel` is an API that provides code intelligence features, likely by analyzing code and providing information about its symbols.
