# CHAT_QUESTION Mind taking a second look at the file? @limit.go

# CHAT_REPLY The `limit.go` file implements functions for limiting the number of search results displayed to the user. It defines a `DisplayTruncator` function that enforces document and match display limits by truncating and mutating the search results. The file also includes functions for limiting the number of chunk matches and line matches within a file. These functions ensure that the search results are manageable and don't overwhelm the user with too much data.
