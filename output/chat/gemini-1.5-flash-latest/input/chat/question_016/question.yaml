# CHAT_QUESTION Mind taking a second look at the file? @limit.go

# CHAT_REPLY The `limit.go` file implements logic for limiting the number of search results displayed to the user. This is crucial for performance and preventing the application from crashing due to overly large result sets. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Here's a breakdown of the key functions:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **`SortAndTruncateFiles`**: This function sorts the search results by score and then applies truncation based on the search options.
# CHAT_REPLY * **`DisplayTruncator`**: This is a function type that represents a stateful function for truncating search results. It enforces document and match display limits.
# CHAT_REPLY * **`NewDisplayTruncator`**: This function creates a `DisplayTruncator` based on the search options. It determines if any limits need to be enforced.
# CHAT_REPLY * **`limitMatches`**: This function limits the number of matches (either line matches or chunk matches) within each file. It uses helper functions `limitChunkMatches` and `limitLineMatches` to handle different match types.
# CHAT_REPLY * **`limitChunkMatches`**: This function limits the number of chunk matches within a file. It truncates the `Ranges`, `SymbolInfo`, and `Content` fields accordingly.
# CHAT_REPLY * **`limitLineMatches`**: This function limits the number of line matches within a file. It truncates the `LineFragments` field.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Overall, this file ensures that the search results are presented in a manageable and efficient way, preventing the application from being overwhelmed by large result sets.
