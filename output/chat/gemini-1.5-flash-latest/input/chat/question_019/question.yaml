# CHAT_QUESTION Explain the logic in src/agent.go, particularly how agents interact with ranking

# CHAT_REPLY The `src/agent.go` file defines the core logic for agents in Zoekt, which are responsible for searching and ranking results. Here's a high-level overview:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **Agents are responsible for searching and ranking results.** They take a query and a set of repositories as input and return a ranked list of results.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Agents use a variety of ranking algorithms.** These algorithms take into account factors such as the relevance of the query to the document, the popularity of the document, and the freshness of the document.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Agents can be configured to use different ranking algorithms.** This allows users to customize the ranking behavior of Zoekt to meet their specific needs.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Agents interact with the ranking system through a set of interfaces.** These interfaces define the methods that agents must implement to interact with the ranking system.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY In short, agents are the heart of Zoekt's search and ranking capabilities. They use a variety of algorithms to rank results based on factors like relevance, popularity, and freshness, and they can be configured to use different algorithms to meet specific needs.
