# CHAT_QUESTION Explain the logic in src/agent.go, particularly how agents interact with ranking

# CHAT_REPLY Let's break down the logic in `src/agent.go` and how agents interact with ranking in Zoekt.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY **Agents and Ranking**
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Zoekt uses agents to perform various tasks related to searching and indexing.  The `agent.go` file defines the `Agent` interface and implements several agent types.  Here's how agents relate to ranking:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **Agents as Search Workers:** Agents are responsible for executing search queries.  They fetch relevant data from shards (indexed data), process it, and return results.
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **Ranking Within Agents:** Some agents, like `SearchAgent`, have built-in ranking logic. They use techniques like:
# CHAT_REPLY    - **Scoring:**  Assigning scores to search results based on factors like:
# CHAT_REPLY       - **Term Frequency:** How often a search term appears in a document.
# CHAT_REPLY       - **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF):**  How rare a term is across the entire index.
# CHAT_REPLY       - **Proximity:** How close search terms are to each other in a document.
# CHAT_REPLY    - **Sorting:**  Ordering search results based on their scores.
# CHAT_REPLY 3. **Ranking Across Agents:**  The `SearchAgent` is responsible for combining results from multiple agents (e.g., `FileAgent`, `SymbolAgent`) and applying a global ranking algorithm. This ensures that the most relevant results are presented to the user.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY **Key Components in `src/agent.go`**
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **`Agent` Interface:** Defines the core methods that all agents must implement:
# CHAT_REPLY    - `Search(ctx context.Context, query *Query, opts *SearchOptions) (*SearchResult, error)`: Executes a search query and returns results.
# CHAT_REPLY    - `Close() error`:  Closes the agent and releases resources.
# CHAT_REPLY * **`SearchAgent`:**  The primary search agent. It orchestrates the search process, combining results from other agents and applying global ranking.
# CHAT_REPLY * **`FileAgent`:**  Searches for text within files. It uses a simple ranking algorithm based on term frequency and IDF.
# CHAT_REPLY * **`SymbolAgent`:**  Searches for symbols (e.g., function names, variables) within code. It uses a more sophisticated ranking algorithm that considers symbol context and relevance.
# CHAT_REPLY * **`BranchesReposAgent`:**  A specialized agent for searching across multiple branches and repositories.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY **Example: `SearchAgent` Ranking**
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY ```go
# CHAT_REPLY // SearchAgent combines results from multiple agents and applies global ranking.
# CHAT_REPLY type SearchAgent struct {
# CHAT_REPLY     // ... other fields ...
# CHAT_REPLY }
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY func (a *SearchAgent) Search(ctx context.Context, query *Query, opts *SearchOptions) (*SearchResult, error) {
# CHAT_REPLY     // ...
# CHAT_REPLY     // 1. Execute searches using other agents (e.g., FileAgent, SymbolAgent)
# CHAT_REPLY     // 2. Combine results from all agents
# CHAT_REPLY     // 3. Apply global ranking algorithm to sort results
# CHAT_REPLY     // ...
# CHAT_REPLY }
# CHAT_REPLY ```
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY **Key Points**
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **Ranking is a core part of Zoekt's search functionality.**
# CHAT_REPLY * **Agents play a crucial role in both executing searches and applying ranking algorithms.**
# CHAT_REPLY * **The `SearchAgent` is responsible for orchestrating the search process and applying global ranking.**
