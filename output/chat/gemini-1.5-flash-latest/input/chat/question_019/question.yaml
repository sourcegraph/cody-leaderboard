# CHAT_QUESTION Explain the logic in src/agent.go, particularly how agents interact with ranking

# CHAT_REPLY The `src/agent.go` file defines the core logic for agents in the system. Agents are responsible for managing and executing search tasks, including ranking. Here's a breakdown of how they interact with ranking:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **Search Request:** An agent receives a search request, which includes the search query and any relevant parameters.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **Query Parsing:** The agent parses the query to understand the search intent and identify any ranking-related criteria. This might involve extracting specific fields, operators, or ranking modifiers.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. **Ranking Strategy:** Based on the parsed query, the agent selects an appropriate ranking strategy. This strategy could involve:
# CHAT_REPLY     * **Simple Ranking:** Using basic relevance scores based on term frequency and document length.
# CHAT_REPLY     * **Advanced Ranking:** Employing more sophisticated algorithms like BM25, TF-IDF, or PageRank.
# CHAT_REPLY     * **Custom Ranking:** Implementing user-defined ranking functions or rules.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. **Ranking Execution:** The agent applies the chosen ranking strategy to the search results. This involves calculating relevance scores for each document and sorting them accordingly.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. **Result Filtering:** The agent may apply additional filtering or post-processing to the ranked results, such as limiting the number of results or applying relevance thresholds.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 6. **Result Return:** The agent returns the ranked and filtered results to the user.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY **Key Points:**
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * Agents are responsible for orchestrating the entire search process, including ranking.
# CHAT_REPLY * The specific ranking strategy used can vary depending on the search query and system configuration.
# CHAT_REPLY * Agents may leverage external ranking libraries or implement custom ranking logic.
# CHAT_REPLY * The goal is to provide the most relevant and accurate results to the user.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY By understanding how agents interact with ranking, you can customize the search experience and optimize the relevance of search results.
