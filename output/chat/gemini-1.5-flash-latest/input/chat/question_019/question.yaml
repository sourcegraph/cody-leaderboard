# CHAT_QUESTION Explain the logic in src/agent.go, particularly how agents interact with ranking

# CHAT_REPLY Let's break down the logic in `src/agent.go` and how agents interact with ranking in Zoekt.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY **Agent Overview**
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The `agent.go` file defines the `Agent` struct, which represents a search agent. Agents are responsible for:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **Querying:** Executing search queries against the Zoekt index.
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **Ranking:** Applying ranking algorithms to the search results.
# CHAT_REPLY 3. **Filtering:** Filtering results based on user-defined criteria.
# CHAT_REPLY 4. **Sorting:** Sorting the filtered results based on relevance.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY **Ranking in Zoekt**
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Zoekt's ranking system is designed to prioritize relevant search results. It leverages several factors:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **Term Frequency:** How often a search term appears in a document.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF):** How common a term is across the entire index.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Position:** The location of the search term within a document (e.g., closer to the beginning is better).
# CHAT_REPLY * **Proximity:** The distance between multiple search terms within a document.
# CHAT_REPLY * **File Type:** The type of file (e.g., code files are often prioritized over documentation).
# CHAT_REPLY * **Symbol Information:** If available, the presence of symbols (like function names or variables) matching the search terms.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY **Agent Interaction with Ranking**
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The `Agent` struct in `agent.go` interacts with ranking in the following ways:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **Query Execution:** When an agent executes a query, it retrieves raw search results from the index. These results are not yet ranked.
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **Ranking Function:** The `Agent` struct has a `Rank` method that applies the ranking logic to the raw results. This method uses a `Ranker` interface, which allows for different ranking algorithms to be plugged in.
# CHAT_REPLY 3. **Ranking Algorithm:** The default ranking algorithm in Zoekt is implemented in the `DefaultRanker` struct. It combines the factors mentioned above to calculate a relevance score for each result.
# CHAT_REPLY 4. **Filtering and Sorting:** After ranking, the `Agent` struct can apply filters (e.g., limiting results to specific file types) and sort the results based on the calculated relevance scores.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY **Example**
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Let's imagine a search for "function foo" in a codebase.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **Query Execution:** The agent executes the query and retrieves a list of files containing "function" and "foo."
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **Ranking:** The `Rank` method applies the `DefaultRanker` to calculate a relevance score for each file based on the frequency of "function" and "foo," their positions, and other factors.
# CHAT_REPLY 3. **Filtering:** The agent might filter the results to only include code files (e.g., .cpp, .java).
# CHAT_REPLY 4. **Sorting:** The agent sorts the remaining files in descending order of their relevance scores.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY **Key Points**
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * Zoekt's ranking system is designed to be flexible and extensible.
# CHAT_REPLY * The `Agent` struct provides a central point for managing search queries, ranking, filtering, and sorting.
# CHAT_REPLY * The `Ranker` interface allows for different ranking algorithms to be used.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Let me know if you have any more questions about the `agent.go` file or Zoekt's ranking system.
