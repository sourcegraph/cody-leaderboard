 question: how do goroutines work?
# CHAT
# CHAT_REPLY The code you provided doesn't directly explain how goroutines work. It uses them, but it doesn't delve into their underlying mechanics. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Here's a breakdown of how goroutines work in Go:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY **Goroutines: Lightweight Threads**
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **Concurrency, not Parallelism:** Goroutines are lightweight, user-level threads managed by the Go runtime. They enable concurrent execution of code, meaning multiple tasks can run seemingly simultaneously. However, they don't necessarily run in parallel on multiple CPU cores. The Go runtime schedules goroutines onto available threads.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Stack Management:** Goroutines have a small, dynamically growing stack. This means they use memory efficiently compared to traditional threads, which have a fixed stack size.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Channels for Communication:** Goroutines communicate with each other using channels, which are typed communication pipes. This allows them to exchange data and synchronize their actions.

# CHAT_REPLY **Example:**
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY ```go
# CHAT_REPLY package main
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY import (
# CHAT_REPLY 	"fmt"
# CHAT_REPLY 	"time"
# CHAT_REPLY )
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY func worker(id int, jobs <-chan int, results chan<- int) {
# CHAT_REPLY 	for j := range jobs {
# CHAT_REPLY 		fmt.Printf("Worker %d started job %d\n", id, j)
# CHAT_REPLY 		time
# CHAT_REPLY ```
