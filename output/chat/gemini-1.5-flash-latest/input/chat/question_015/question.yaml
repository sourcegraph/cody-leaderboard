# CHAT_QUESTION Can you look through the files and identify the conflicting packages that may be causing this?

# CHAT_REPLY The code you provided is from the `zoekt` package. It appears to be a function that limits the number of files, matches, and chunks displayed in search results. There are no conflicting packages identified in this code snippet. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To identify conflicting packages, you would need to provide more context, such as:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **The error message you are encountering.**
# CHAT_REPLY * **The specific code that is causing the conflict.**
# CHAT_REPLY * **The packages involved in the conflict.**
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Once you provide this information, I can help you identify the conflicting packages and suggest solutions.
