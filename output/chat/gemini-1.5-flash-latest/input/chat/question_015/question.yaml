# CHAT_QUESTION Can you look through the files and identify the conflicting packages that may be causing this?

# CHAT_REPLY The code you provided doesn't contain any information about conflicting packages. It's a single file from the `zoekt` package, and there's no indication of any conflicts within it. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To identify conflicting packages, I would need more information:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **Error messages:** What error messages are you seeing?
# CHAT_REPLY * **Build logs:** Can you share the output of your build process?
# CHAT_REPLY * **Dependency information:** What are the dependencies of your project?
# CHAT_REPLY * **Specific code:** If you suspect a conflict in a specific part of your code, please share it.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY With more context, I can help you pinpoint the source of the conflict and suggest solutions.
