# CHAT_QUESTION Can you look through the files and identify the conflicting packages that may be causing this?

# CHAT_REPLY Please provide me with more context! I need to know what the conflict is before I can identify conflicting packages. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY For example, tell me:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **What is the error message you're seeing?**
# CHAT_REPLY * **What are you trying to do?** (e.g., build the project, run a specific command, etc.)
# CHAT_REPLY * **What specific files or lines of code are you looking at?**
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY With more information, I can help you pinpoint the source of the conflict.

 files:
   - ../mocked/codebase_context/README.md
   - ../mocked/codebase_context/limit.go
