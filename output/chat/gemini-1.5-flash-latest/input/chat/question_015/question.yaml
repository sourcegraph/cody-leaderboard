# CHAT_QUESTION Can you look through the files and identify the conflicting packages that may be causing this?

# CHAT_REPLY Please provide me with the error message or the specific issue you are facing. I need more context to understand what conflicting packages you are referring to. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY For example, tell me:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **What are you trying to do?** (e.g., build the project, run a specific command, etc.)
# CHAT_REPLY * **What error message are you getting?** 
# CHAT_REPLY * **What are the specific packages involved?**
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Once I have this information, I can help you identify any potential conflicts.
