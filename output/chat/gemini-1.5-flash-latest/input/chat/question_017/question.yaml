# CHAT_QUESTION Why does this project use the MIT license?

# CHAT_REPLY The provided codebase context doesn't explicitly state the reason for using the MIT license. However, we can infer some likely reasons:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **Simplicity and permissiveness:** The MIT license is one of the most permissive open-source licenses. It allows for wide use and modification of the code with minimal restrictions. This encourages wider adoption and contribution to the project.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Alignment with Google's open-source philosophy:** Google has a strong history of open-source contributions, and the MIT license aligns with their general approach to open-source software.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Encouraging community involvement:** By using a permissive license, the project encourages developers to contribute to the codebase, improve it, and share their modifications with the community.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY It's important to note that the specific reason for choosing the MIT license might be more nuanced and could be influenced by factors not explicitly mentioned in the codebase context.
