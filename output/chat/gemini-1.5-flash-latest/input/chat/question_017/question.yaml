# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **Simplicity and permissiveness:** The MIT license is one of the most permissive open-source licenses. It allows for wide use and modification of the code with minimal restrictions. This makes it attractive for projects like Zoekt, which aim to be widely adopted and used by developers.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Encouraging contributions:** The permissive nature of the MIT license encourages developers to contribute to the project without worrying about complex licensing terms. This can lead to a more active and diverse community around the project.
