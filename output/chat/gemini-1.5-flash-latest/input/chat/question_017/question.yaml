# CHAT_QUESTION Why does this project use the MIT license?

# CHAT_REPLY The provided codebase context doesn't explicitly state why the project uses the MIT license.  To find the reason, you would need to look at the project's LICENSE file or its history. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY However, the MIT license is a very common and permissive license. It's often chosen for these reasons:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **Simplicity:** It's easy to understand and apply.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Flexibility:** It allows users to modify, distribute, and use the code freely, even for commercial purposes.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Minimal restrictions:** It only requires attribution to the original author.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Without further information, it's safe to assume the project chose the MIT license for its simplicity and permissiveness, allowing for wider adoption and use.
