# CHAT_REPLY The `README.md` file provides an overview of the `@sourcegraph/cody-agent` package. It explains that this package implements a JSON-RPC server to facilitate interaction with Cody through standard input and output (stdout/stdin). The package is designed for use by clients that are not written in ECMAScript, such as plugins for JetBrains and NeoVim.
