 question: explain @README.md
# CHAT
# CHAT_REPLY The `README.md` file for the `@sourcegraph/cody-agent` package provides a brief overview of the package's purpose and functionality. Specifically, it explains that the package implements a JSON-RPC server to facilitate interaction with Cody through standard input and output (stdout/stdin). This setup is designed to be used by clients that are not based on ECMAScript, such as plugins for JetBrains and NeoVim.
