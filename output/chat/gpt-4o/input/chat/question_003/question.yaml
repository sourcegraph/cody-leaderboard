# CHAT_QUESTION What code do you have access to?

# CHAT_REPLY I have access to the codebase context for Zoekt, a fast text search engine designed for source code. This includes instructions for downloading, indexing, searching, and installing Zoekt, as well as details about its web interface, JSON API, CLI, and search service. Additionally, I have information about the fork from Google's original Zoekt repository to Sourcegraph's maintained version, including specific changes and enhancements made by Sourcegraph.
