# CHAT_QUESTION What code do you have access to?

# CHAT_REPLY I have access to the content of the `mocked/codebase_context/README.md` file, which provides an overview and instructions for using Zoekt, a fast text search engine for source code. The README includes details on downloading, indexing, searching, installation, and additional features like symbol search and service management. It also mentions the differences between the Sourcegraph fork and the original Google version of Zoekt.
