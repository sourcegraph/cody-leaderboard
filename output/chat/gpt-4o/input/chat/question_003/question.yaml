# CHAT_QUESTION What code do you have access to?

# CHAT_REPLY I have access to the codebase context from the file `mocked/codebase_context/README.md`, which includes information about Zoekt, a fast text search engine for source code. The file contains instructions for downloading, indexing, searching, and installing Zoekt, as well as details about its search service, symbol search, acknowledgements, and fork details.
