# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided context, I have access to the contents of the `mocked/codebase_context/README.md` file. This file includes information about Zoekt, a fast text search engine for source code, and provides instructions for downloading, indexing, searching, and installing Zoekt. It also includes details about the search service, symbol search, acknowledgements, and differences between the Sourcegraph fork and the original Google version.
