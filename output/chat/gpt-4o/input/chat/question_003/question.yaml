# CHAT_QUESTION What code do you have access to?

# CHAT_REPLY I have access to the codebase context provided in the file `mocked/codebase_context/README.md`. This file contains information about Zoekt, a fast text search engine for source code, including instructions on downloading, indexing, searching, installation, and service management. It also includes details about the Sourcegraph fork of Zoekt and its differences from the original Google version. If you need help with any specific part of this codebase or have any questions, feel free to ask!
