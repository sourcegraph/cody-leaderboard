# CHAT_QUESTION Are you capable of upgrading my pytorch version to 1.0.0, there is a guide in the pytorch site

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided context, I don't have information about any Python or PyTorch-related files in the codebase. Therefore, I can't directly assist with upgrading your PyTorch version within this specific codebase context.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY However, I can guide you through the process of upgrading PyTorch to version 1.0.0. Here are the general steps you can follow:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **Uninstall the current version of PyTorch:**
# CHAT_REPLY    ```bash
# CHAT_REPLY    pip uninstall torch
# CHAT_REPLY    ```
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **Install PyTorch 1.0.0:**
# CHAT_REPLY    You can install a specific version of PyTorch using pip. For version 1.0.0, you can use the following command:
# CHAT_REPLY    ```bash
# CHAT_REPLY    pip install torch==1.0.0
# CHAT_REPLY    ```
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. **Verify the installation:**
# CHAT_REPLY    After installation, you can verify the version of PyTorch to ensure it has been upgraded correctly:
# CHAT_REPLY    ```python
# CHAT_REPLY    import torch
# CHAT_REPLY    print(torch.__version__)
# CHAT_REPLY    ```
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY For more detailed instructions, you can refer to the official [PyTorch installation guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/).
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you need further assistance with specific code changes or dependencies related to the upgrade, please provide more context or specific files related to your PyTorch usage.
