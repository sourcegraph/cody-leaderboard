# CHAT_QUESTION Are you capable of upgrading my pytorch version to 1.0.0, there is a guide in the pytorch site

# CHAT_REPLY Yes, I can help guide you through upgrading your PyTorch version to 1.0.0. Hereâ€™s a high-level overview of the steps you need to follow:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **Check Current Version**: First, check your current PyTorch version to confirm the upgrade is necessary.
# CHAT_REPLY    ```python
# CHAT_REPLY    import torch
# CHAT_REPLY    print(torch.__version__)
# CHAT_REPLY    ```
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **Uninstall Current Version**: Uninstall the current version of PyTorch.
# CHAT_REPLY    ```bash
# CHAT_REPLY    pip uninstall torch
# CHAT_REPLY    ```
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. **Install PyTorch 1.0.0**: Install the desired version of PyTorch. You can find the specific installation command for your environment (OS, CUDA version, etc.) on the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/). For example, for a basic CPU-only installation, you can use:
# CHAT_REPLY    ```bash
# CHAT_REPLY    pip install torch==1.0.0 torchvision==0.2.1
# CHAT_REPLY    ```
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. **Verify Installation**: Verify that the installation was successful and that the correct version is installed.
# CHAT_REPLY    ```python
# CHAT_REPLY    import torch
# CHAT_REPLY    print(torch.__version__)
# CHAT_REPLY    ```
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. **Update Dependencies**: Ensure that any dependencies or related libraries are compatible with PyTorch 1.0.0. This might involve updating or reinstalling libraries such as `torchvision`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 6. **Test Your Code**: Run your existing code to ensure that everything works as expected with the new version. Pay attention to any deprecation warnings or errors that might arise due to changes in the API.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY By following these steps, you should be able to upgrade your PyTorch version to 1.0.0 smoothly. If you encounter any specific issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
