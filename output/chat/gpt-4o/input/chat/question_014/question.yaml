# CHAT_QUESTION Are you capable of upgrading my pytorch version to 1.0.0, there is a guide in the pytorch site

# CHAT_REPLY I can certainly help guide you through the process of upgrading your PyTorch version to 1.0.0. However, I don't have direct access to your system to perform the upgrade myself. Here are the steps you can follow to upgrade PyTorch to version 1.0.0:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **Uninstall the current version of PyTorch** (if installed):
# CHAT_REPLY    ```bash
# CHAT_REPLY    pip uninstall torch
# CHAT_REPLY    ```
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **Install PyTorch 1.0.0**:
# CHAT_REPLY    You can install PyTorch 1.0.0 using pip. The command will vary slightly depending on your operating system and whether you want to use CUDA (for GPU support) or just the CPU version.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY    - **For CPU only**:
# CHAT_REPLY      ```bash
# CHAT_REPLY      pip install torch==1.0.0 torchvision==0.2.1
# CHAT_REPLY      ```
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY    - **For CUDA 9.0**:
# CHAT_REPLY      ```bash
# CHAT_REPLY      pip install torch==1.0.0 torchvision==0.2.1 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu90/stable
# CHAT_REPLY      ```
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY    - **For CUDA 10.0**:
# CHAT_REPLY      ```bash
# CHAT_REPLY      pip install torch==1.0.0 torchvision==0.2.1 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu100/stable
# CHAT_REPLY      ```
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. **Verify the installation**:
# CHAT_REPLY    After installation, you can verify that the correct version of PyTorch is installed by running:
# CHAT_REPLY    ```python
# CHAT_REPLY    import torch
# CHAT_REPLY    print(torch.__version__)
# CHAT_REPLY    ```
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY This should output `1.0.0`, confirming that the upgrade was successful.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY For more detailed instructions or troubleshooting, you can refer to the official [PyTorch installation guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/).
