# CHAT_QUESTION Can you look through the files and identify the conflicting packages that may be causing this?

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided context, there are no indications of conflicting packages. The files `README.md` and `limit.go` do not show any import statements or dependencies that might conflict with each other.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To identify conflicting packages, you would typically look for:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **Import Statements**: Check if multiple versions of the same package are being imported.
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **Dependency Management Files**: Look at `go.mod` or `Gopkg.toml` files for version conflicts.
# CHAT_REPLY 3. **Error Messages**: Look for specific error messages that indicate conflicts.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Since the provided context does not include such details, I cannot identify any conflicting packages. If you provide more information, such as error messages or additional files, I might be able to help further.

 files:
   - ../mocked/codebase_context/README.md
   - ../mocked/codebase_context/limit.go
