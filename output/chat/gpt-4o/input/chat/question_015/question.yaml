# CHAT_QUESTION Can you look through the files and identify the conflicting packages that may be causing this?

# CHAT_REPLY To identify conflicting packages, we need to look for import statements and package declarations in the provided codebase context. Based on the context provided, here are the relevant details:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **File: `mocked/codebase_context/README.md`**
# CHAT_REPLY    - This file is a markdown file and does not contain any Go code or import statements.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **File: `mocked/codebase_context/limit.go`**
# CHAT_REPLY    - Package declaration: `package zoekt`
# CHAT_REPLY    - Import statement: `import "log"`
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY From the provided context, there is only one Go file (`limit.go`) which imports the `log` package. There are no other import statements or package declarations that could potentially conflict with each other.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY ### Conclusion
# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided context, there are no conflicting packages identified. The only imported package is `log`, and it does not conflict with any other package in the provided codebase context. If there are issues in the codebase, they might be due to other reasons not covered in the provided context. If you have more files or specific error messages, please provide them for a more thorough analysis.
