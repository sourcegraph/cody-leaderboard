# CHAT_QUESTION Can you look through the files and identify the conflicting packages that may be causing this?

# CHAT_REPLY To identify conflicting packages, we need to look at the imports and usage within the provided file. Here are the imported packages in `mocked_context/limit.go`:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY ```go
# CHAT_REPLY import (
# CHAT_REPLY 	"context"
# CHAT_REPLY 	"fmt"
# CHAT_REPLY 	"net/http"
# CHAT_REPLY 	"slices"
# CHAT_REPLY 	"strconv"
# CHAT_REPLY 	"time"
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 	"github.com/sourcegraph/log"
# CHAT_REPLY 	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/attribute"
# CHAT_REPLY 	oteltrace "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace"
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 	"github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/cmd/cody-gateway/internal/limiter"
# CHAT_REPLY 	"github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/internal/codygateway"
# CHAT_REPLY 	"github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/internal/trace"
# CHAT_REPLY 	"github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/lib/errors"
# CHAT_REPLY )
# CHAT_REPLY ```
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To identify conflicts, we need to check for:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **Duplicate Imports**: Same package imported multiple times.
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **Version Conflicts**: Different versions of the same package imported.
# CHAT_REPLY 3. **Namespace Conflicts**: Different packages imported with the same alias.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY From the provided context, there are no obvious duplicate imports or alias conflicts. However, without additional files or more context, it's challenging to identify version conflicts directly.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Here are some steps you can take to further investigate:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **Check for Duplicate Imports**: Ensure no package is imported more than once.
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **Check for Version Conflicts**: If using Go modules, inspect the `go.mod` file for multiple versions of the same package.
# CHAT_REPLY 3. **Namespace Conflicts**: Ensure no two packages are imported with the same alias.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you have access to the `go.mod` file or other parts of the codebase, you can look for these issues there. If you can provide more specific details or additional files, I can help you further pinpoint the conflict.
