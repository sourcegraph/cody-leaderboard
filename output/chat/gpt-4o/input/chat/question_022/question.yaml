# CHAT_QUESTION what does @limit.go do?

# CHAT_REPLY The `limit.go` file in your codebase is responsible for managing and enforcing display limits on search results, specifically for files and matches within those files. Here's a high-level overview of its functionality:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **Sorting and Truncating Files**:
# CHAT_REPLY    - The `SortAndTruncateFiles` function sorts a list of file matches and then truncates them based on specified search options.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **Display Truncator**:
# CHAT_REPLY    - The `DisplayTruncator` type is a function that enforces limits on the number of documents and matches displayed. It ensures that the results do not exceed the specified limits.
# CHAT_REPLY    - The `NewDisplayTruncator` function creates a `DisplayTruncator` based on the provided search options. It returns a function that can be used to truncate file matches according to the limits.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. **Limiting Matches**:
# CHAT_REPLY    - The `limitMatches` function applies limits to the matches within files. It uses either `limitChunkMatches` or `limitLineMatches` depending on whether chunk matches or line matches are being limited.
# CHAT_REPLY    - The `limitChunkMatches` function limits the number of chunk matches in a file, adjusting the content, ranges, and symbol information accordingly.
# CHAT_REPLY    - The `limitLineMatches` function limits the number of line matches in a file by truncating the line fragments.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Overall, this file ensures that search results are displayed within the specified limits, providing a controlled and manageable output for users.
