# CHAT_QUESTION what does @limit.go do?

# CHAT_REPLY The `limit.go` file in the provided codebase context is part of the `zoekt` package. It primarily deals with sorting and truncating search results based on specified search options. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **Sorting and Truncating Files:**
# CHAT_REPLY    - The `SortAndTruncateFiles` function sorts a list of `FileMatch` objects and then truncates them based on the provided search options (`SearchOptions`). It uses a `DisplayTruncator` to enforce limits on the number of documents and matches displayed.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **Display Truncator:**
# CHAT_REPLY    - The `DisplayTruncator` type is a function that takes a list of `FileMatch` objects and returns a truncated list along with a boolean indicating whether more results are available.
# CHAT_REPLY    - The `NewDisplayTruncator` function creates a `DisplayTruncator` based on the limits specified in the `SearchOptions`. If no limits are set, it returns a no-op truncator.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. **Limiting Matches:**
# CHAT_REPLY    - The `limitMatches` function enforces limits on the number of matches within each `FileMatch`. It uses either `limitChunkMatches` or `limitLineMatches` depending on whether chunk matches or line matches are being limited.
# CHAT_REPLY    - `limitChunkMatches` limits the number of `ChunkMatches` in a `FileMatch`, adjusting related fields such as `Ranges`, `SymbolInfo`, and `Content`.
# CHAT_REPLY    - `limitLineMatches` limits the number of `LineMatches` in a `FileMatch`, specifically the `LineFragments` within each `LineMatch`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Overall, the file provides mechanisms to sort and limit search results to ensure they adhere to specified display constraints, improving the efficiency and usability of search operations.
