# CHAT_QUESTION \@zoekt describe my code.

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided codebase context, here's a description of the code:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY ### TypeScript Files
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **squirrel.ts**:
# CHAT_REPLY    - Defines an interface `CodeIntelligence` with a property `symbols` which is an array of strings.
# CHAT_REPLY    - Defines an interface `Squirrel` which has a method `symbolInformation` that takes a file path as a string and returns `CodeIntelligence`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **animal.ts**:
# CHAT_REPLY    - Defines an interface `Animal` with properties `name` (a string) and `age` (a number).
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY ### Go Files
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **agent.go**:
# CHAT_REPLY    - Contains a package `agent`.
# CHAT_REPLY    - Defines a struct `Agent` (though the struct's fields and methods are not provided in the snippet).
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **limit.go**:
# CHAT_REPLY    - Contains a package `actor`.
# CHAT_REPLY    - Defines a struct `RateLimit` with properties related to rate limiting, such as `AllowedModels`, `Limit`, `Interval`, `ConcurrentRequests`, and `ConcurrentRequestsInterval`.
# CHAT_REPLY    - Provides a function `NewRateLimitWithPercentageConcurrency` to create a new `RateLimit` with concurrency settings.
# CHAT_REPLY    - Defines methods for `RateLimit` such as `IsValid` and `EvaluateAllowedModels`.
# CHAT_REPLY    - Defines a struct `concurrencyLimiter` with methods `TryAcquire` and `Usage` to handle concurrency limits.
# CHAT_REPLY    - Defines an error type `ErrConcurrencyLimitExceeded` with methods for error handling and response writing.
# CHAT_REPLY    - Defines a struct `updateOnErrorLimiter` with methods `TryAcquire` and `Usage` to handle updates on certain access errors.

# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **README.md**:
# CHAT_REPLY    - Describes the `@sourcegraph/cody-agent` package.
# CHAT_REPLY    - States that the package implements a JSON-RPC server to interact with Cody via stdout/stdin.
# CHAT_REPLY    - Mentions that the package is intended for non-ECMAScript clients such as JetBrains and NeoVim plugins.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY This codebase appears to be part of a larger project related to Sourcegraph's Cody, involving both TypeScript and Go components. The TypeScript files define interfaces for code intelligence and animal data, while the Go files handle rate limiting and concurrency control for some form of agent or actor system. The README provides an overview of a specific package within the project.
