# CHAT_QUESTION \@zoekt describe my code.

# CHAT_REPLY Certainly! Based on the provided context, your codebase appears to be a mix of TypeScript and Go, with a focus on code intelligence, rate limiting, and concurrency management. Here's a high-level overview:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY ### TypeScript Code
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **Code Intelligence API (`squirrel.ts`)**:
# CHAT_REPLY    - Defines interfaces for code intelligence, specifically focusing on symbol information within files.
# CHAT_REPLY    - `CodeIntelligence` interface holds an array of symbols.
# CHAT_REPLY    - `Squirrel` interface provides a method `symbolInformation` to retrieve code intelligence for a given file.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **Animal Interface (`animal.ts`)**:
# CHAT_REPLY    - Defines a simple interface for an `Animal` with properties `name` and `age`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY ### Go Code
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **Agent Package (`agent.go`)**:
# CHAT_REPLY    - Contains a placeholder for an `Agent` type, which might be expanded with more functionality.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **Actor Package (`limit.go`)**:
# CHAT_REPLY    - Implements rate limiting and concurrency control mechanisms.
# CHAT_REPLY    - Defines a `RateLimit` struct to manage allowed models, limits, and intervals.
# CHAT_REPLY    - Provides methods to evaluate allowed models and validate rate limits.
# CHAT_REPLY    - Implements concurrency limiting with a `concurrencyLimiter` struct, handling rate limit acquisition and usage tracking.
# CHAT_REPLY    - Defines error handling for concurrency limit exceedance with `ErrConcurrencyLimitExceeded`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY ### Documentation (`README.md`)
# CHAT_REPLY - Describes the `@sourcegraph/cody-agent` package, which implements a JSON-RPC server for interacting with Cody via stdout/stdin, intended for use by non-ECMAScript clients like JetBrains and NeoVim plugins.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY ### Summary
# CHAT_REPLY Your codebase is structured to handle code intelligence features, rate limiting, and concurrency management, with clear interfaces and structs to manage these functionalities. The documentation provides a concise description of the `cody-agent` package's purpose and usage.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you have any specific questions or need further details on any part of the codebase, feel free to ask!
