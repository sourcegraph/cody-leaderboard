# CHAT_QUESTION \@zoekt describe my code.

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided context, it appears that you have a Go file defining a `server` struct and a README file describing the `@sourcegraph/cody-agent` package. However, there isn't enough information to provide a detailed description of your entire codebase.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you need a description of the specific code snippets provided:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **Go File (`mocked_context/chunker_test.go`):**
# CHAT_REPLY    - The `server` struct embeds `grpc_testing.UnimplementedTestServiceServer`, which suggests that it's part of a gRPC service implementation, likely used for testing purposes.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **README File (`mocked_context/README.md`):**
# CHAT_REPLY    - The `@sourcegraph/cody-agent` package implements a JSON-RPC server to interact with Cody via stdout/stdin. It's designed for use by non-ECMAScript clients, such as JetBrains and NeoVim plugins.
