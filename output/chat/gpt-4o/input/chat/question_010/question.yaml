# CHAT_QUESTION \@zoekt describe my code.

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided codebase context, here's a brief description of your code:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **TypeScript Interfaces**:
# CHAT_REPLY    - **CodeIntelligence**: This interface represents a structure with a single property `symbols`, which is an array of strings.
# CHAT_REPLY    - **Squirrel**: This interface represents a code intelligence API with a method `symbolInformation` that takes a file path as a string and returns a `CodeIntelligence` object.
# CHAT_REPLY    - **Animal**: This interface represents an animal with properties `name` (a string) and `age` (a number).
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **Go Code**:
# CHAT_REPLY    - **agent.go**: This file defines an `Agent` package, but the provided snippet only includes a comment.
# CHAT_REPLY    - **limit.go**: This file is part of the `actor` package and includes several components related to rate limiting:
# CHAT_REPLY      - **RateLimit**: A struct that defines rate limiting parameters such as allowed models, limit, interval, and concurrent request settings.
# CHAT_REPLY      - **NewRateLimitWithPercentageConcurrency**: A function to create a new `RateLimit` with concurrency settings based on a percentage of the daily limit.
# CHAT_REPLY      - **IsValid**: A method to check if a `RateLimit` instance is valid.
# CHAT_REPLY      - **EvaluateAllowedModels**: A method to evaluate allowed models based on a master allowlist.
# CHAT_REPLY      - **concurrencyLimiter**: A struct that implements concurrency limiting logic using a Redis store.
# CHAT_REPLY      - **TryAcquire**: A method to attempt acquiring a concurrency limit.
# CHAT_REPLY      - **Usage**: A method to get the current usage of the limiter.
# CHAT_REPLY      - **ErrConcurrencyLimitExceeded**: An error type for concurrency limit exceeded scenarios.
# CHAT_REPLY      - **updateOnErrorLimiter**: A struct that updates the actor if access errors occur.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. **README.md**:
# CHAT_REPLY    - The `@sourcegraph/cody-agent` package implements a JSON-RPC server to interact with Cody via stdout/stdin. It is intended for use by non-ECMAScript clients such as JetBrains and NeoVim plugins.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Overall, your codebase includes TypeScript interfaces for code intelligence and animal representation, Go code for rate limiting and concurrency control, and documentation for a JSON-RPC server package used by Cody.
