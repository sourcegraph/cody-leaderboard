# CHAT_QUESTION \@zoekt describe my code.

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided context, it seems that the codebase includes several components related to code intelligence, rate limiting, and a JSON-RPC server for interacting with Cody. Here is a brief description of the files you provided:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **squirrel.ts**:
# CHAT_REPLY    - Defines an interface `CodeIntelligence` with a property `symbols` which is an array of strings.
# CHAT_REPLY    - Defines an interface `Squirrel` with a method `symbolInformation` that takes a file name as a string and returns `CodeIntelligence`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **animal.ts**:
# CHAT_REPLY    - Defines an interface `Animal` with properties `name` (string) and `age` (number).
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. **agent.go**:
# CHAT_REPLY    - Contains a package declaration for `agent`.
# CHAT_REPLY    - Includes a brief comment indicating that `Agent` is an agent, but no further implementation details are provided.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. **limit.go**:
# CHAT_REPLY    - Contains a package declaration for `actor`.
# CHAT_REPLY    - Defines a `RateLimit` struct with various fields related to rate limiting, such as `AllowedModels`, `Limit`, `Interval`, and concurrency-related fields.
# CHAT_REPLY    - Provides methods for creating a new rate limit with concurrency, validating the rate limit, and evaluating allowed models.
# CHAT_REPLY    - Defines a `concurrencyLimiter` struct with methods for acquiring and using concurrency limits.
# CHAT_REPLY    - Defines an `ErrConcurrencyLimitExceeded` struct for handling concurrency limit errors, including methods for generating error messages and writing HTTP responses.
# CHAT_REPLY    - Defines an `updateOnErrorLimiter` struct with methods for acquiring limits and handling usage, including updating the actor on certain access errors.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. **README.md**:
# CHAT_REPLY    - Describes the `@sourcegraph/cody-agent` package, which implements a JSON-RPC server to interact with Cody via stdout/stdin.
# CHAT_REPLY    - Indicates that the package is intended for use by non-ECMAScript clients such as JetBrains and NeoVim plugins.
