 question: \@zoekt describe my code.
# CHAT
# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided context, it seems like you are working with a Go codebase that includes a server struct and a JSON-RPC server implementation for interacting with Cody. However, the context is quite limited. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To describe your code more accurately, I would need more information or specific files you want to be described. Given the current context:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **server struct**:
# CHAT_REPLY    - The `server` struct in `chunker_test.go` embeds `grpc_testing.UnimplementedTestServiceServer`. This suggests that it is part of a gRPC service implementation, likely for testing purposes.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **Cody Agent**:
# CHAT_REPLY    - The `@sourcegraph/cody-agent` package implements a JSON-RPC server to interact with Cody via stdout/stdin. It is designed for use by non-ECMAScript clients such as JetBrains and NeoVim plugins.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you need a more detailed description or have specific parts of the codebase you want to be described, please provide additional context or specify the files or components you are interested in.
