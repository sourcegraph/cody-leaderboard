# CHAT_QUESTION \@zoekt describe my code.

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided codebase context, here is a brief description of the code:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **TypeScript Interfaces**:
# CHAT_REPLY     - `squirrel.ts`:
# CHAT_REPLY         - `CodeIntelligence`: An interface representing code intelligence with a list of symbols.
# CHAT_REPLY         - `Squirrel`: An interface representing a code intelligence API with a method `symbolInformation` that takes a file name and returns `CodeIntelligence`.
# CHAT_REPLY     - `animal.ts`:
# CHAT_REPLY         - `Animal`: An interface representing an animal with a name and age.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **Go Packages**:
# CHAT_REPLY     - `agent.go`:
# CHAT_REPLY         - Defines an `Agent` struct (though the full definition is not provided in the snippet).
# CHAT_REPLY     - `limit.go`:
# CHAT_REPLY         - Defines a `RateLimit` struct for managing rate limits, including allowed models, limits, intervals, and concurrency settings.
# CHAT_REPLY         - Provides methods for creating new rate limits with concurrency settings, validating rate limits, and evaluating allowed models.
# CHAT_REPLY         - Defines a `concurrencyLimiter` struct for managing concurrency limits with methods for acquiring and using limits.
# CHAT_REPLY         - Defines an `ErrConcurrencyLimitExceeded` struct for handling concurrency limit exceeded errors, including methods for generating error messages and writing HTTP responses.
# CHAT_REPLY         - Defines an `updateOnErrorLimiter` struct for updating actors on certain access errors, with methods for acquiring limits and checking usage.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. **README**:
# CHAT_REPLY     - Describes the `@sourcegraph/cody-agent` package, which implements a JSON-RPC server to interact with Cody via stdout/stdin. This package is intended for use by non-ECMAScript clients such as JetBrains and NeoVim plugins.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY This codebase appears to be part of a larger system involving code intelligence, rate limiting, and interaction with Cody through a JSON-RPC server.
