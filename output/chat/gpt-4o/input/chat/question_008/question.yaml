# CHAT_QUESTION What does this repo do??

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided code snippet, it appears that this repository is related to search functionality, specifically handling and processing search results. The code includes functions for sorting and truncating search results (`SortAndTruncateFiles`), enforcing display limits on documents and matches (`DisplayTruncator`, `NewDisplayTruncator`), and limiting the number of matches within files (`limitMatches`, `limitChunkMatches`, `limitLineMatches`).

# CHAT_REPLY However, with the given context, it's not possible to determine the full scope or primary purpose of the repository. The code suggests it deals with search results, possibly within a larger search engine or search-related application, but more information or additional files would be needed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the repository's purpose.
