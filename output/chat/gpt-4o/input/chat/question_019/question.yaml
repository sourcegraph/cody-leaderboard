# CHAT_QUESTION Explain the logic in src/agent.go, particularly how agents interact with ranking

# CHAT_REPLY To provide a detailed explanation of the logic in `src/agent.go` and how agents interact with ranking, I would need to see the actual content of the `src/agent.go` file. Since I don't have direct access to the file system, please provide the relevant code or a description of the key functions and logic within `src/agent.go`. This will help me give you a precise and accurate explanation.
