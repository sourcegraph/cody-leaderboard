# CHAT_QUESTION Explain the logic in src/agent.go, particularly how agents interact with ranking

# CHAT_REPLY To explain the logic in `src/agent.go` and how agents interact with ranking, I'll need to look at the contents of the `src/agent.go` file. Since I don't have direct access to the file system, please provide the relevant code or details from `src/agent.go`, and I'll be happy to explain the logic and interactions for you.
