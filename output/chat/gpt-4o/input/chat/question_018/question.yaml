 question: See zoekt repo find location of tensor function
# CHAT
# CHAT_QUESTION See zoekt repo find location of tensor function

# CHAT_REPLY To find the location of the `tensor` function in the Zoekt repository, you can use the search capabilities provided by Zoekt itself or use a code search tool like Sourcegraph. However, since I have access to the codebase context, I can help you locate it directly.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Given the provided context, the `tensor` function is not mentioned in the files you've shared. To locate it, you would typically:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. Use a search tool to look for the definition of the `tensor` function.
# CHAT_REPLY 2. If you have access to the repository, you can use `grep` or similar command-line tools to search for the function name.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY For example, you can run the following command in the root directory of the repository:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY ```sh
# CHAT_REPLY grep -r "func tensor" .
# CHAT_REPLY ```
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY This command will recursively search for the `tensor` function definition in the repository.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you have access to Sourcegraph, you can use its search functionality to look for `func tensor` to find the exact location.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Since I don't have the capability to execute searches directly on your repository, I recommend using one of the methods mentioned above to locate the `tensor` function. If you provide more specific details or additional context, I may be able to assist you further.
