 question: See zoekt repo find location of tensor function

# CHAT_QUESTION See zoekt repo find location of tensor function

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided context, there is no mention of a `tensor` function in the files `README.md`, `limit.go`, or `eval.go`. To locate the `tensor` function within the Zoekt repository, you would typically search through the codebase using a search tool or by manually inspecting the files.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Given that I don't have access to the entire codebase, I recommend using the following methods to find the `tensor` function:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **Using `grep` (or similar command-line tools):**
# CHAT_REPLY    ```sh
# CHAT_REPLY    grep -r "func tensor" /path/to/zoekt/repo
# CHAT_REPLY    ```
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **Using an IDE or text editor with search functionality:**
# CHAT_REPLY    - Open the Zoekt repository in your preferred IDE (e.g., VSCode, IntelliJ).
# CHAT_REPLY    - Use the "Find in Files" feature to search for `func tensor`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. **Using Sourcegraph:**
# CHAT_REPLY    - If the repository is indexed by Sourcegraph, you can use Sourcegraph's search functionality to find the definition of the `tensor` function.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you provide more specific details or additional context, I can offer more targeted assistance.
