# CHAT_QUESTION See zoekt repo find location of tensor function

# CHAT_REPLY To find the location of the `tensor` function in the Zoekt repository, you can use the following approaches:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **Using `grep` or `find` Command:**
# CHAT_REPLY    If you have the repository cloned locally, you can use the `grep` command to search for the `tensor` function definition. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the Zoekt repository, then run:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY    ```sh
# CHAT_REPLY    grep -r "func tensor" .
# CHAT_REPLY    ```
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY    This will recursively search for the `tensor` function definition in the repository.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **Using Sourcegraph:**
# CHAT_REPLY    If the repository is indexed by Sourcegraph, you can use Sourcegraph's search functionality to find the `tensor` function. Go to the Sourcegraph instance that indexes the Zoekt repository and use the search query:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY    ```
# CHAT_REPLY    repo:sourcegraph/zoekt func tensor
# CHAT_REPLY    ```
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY    This will search for the `tensor` function definition within the `sourcegraph/zoekt` repository.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. **Using an IDE:**
# CHAT_REPLY    If you are using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code, GoLand, or any other IDE that supports Go, you can use the "Go to Symbol" or "Find in Files" feature to search for the `tensor` function.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. **Manual Search:**
# CHAT_REPLY    If the codebase is not too large, you can manually look through the files to find the `tensor` function. Typically, function definitions are located in `.go` files.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Since I have access to the provided codebase context, I can confirm that the `tensor` function is not defined in the provided snippets (`README.md`, `limit.go`, and `eval.go`). You will need to search the rest of the codebase using one of the methods mentioned above to locate the `tensor` function.
