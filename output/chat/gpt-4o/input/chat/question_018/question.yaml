 question: See zoekt repo find location of tensor function

# CHAT_QUESTION See zoekt repo find location of tensor function

# CHAT_REPLY To locate the `tensor` function within the provided codebase context, you can use the search functionality of your code editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) to search for the keyword `func tensor` across the codebase. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY However, based on the provided context, there is no direct mention or definition of a `tensor` function in the files `README.md`, `limit.go`, or `eval.go`. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you have access to the entire repository, you can perform a search using the following methods:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY ### Using Command Line
# CHAT_REPLY You can use `grep` to search for the function definition across the codebase:
# CHAT_REPLY ```sh
# CHAT_REPLY grep -rnw 'path/to/zoekt/repo' -e 'func tensor'
# CHAT_REPLY ```
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY ### Using an IDE
# CHAT_REPLY Most modern IDEs like Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, or GoLand have a "Find in Files" feature. You can open the search bar and type `func tensor` to locate the function definition.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY ### Using Sourcegraph
# CHAT_REPLY If you have access to Sourcegraph, you can use its powerful search capabilities to find the function definition:
# CHAT_REPLY 1. Go to your Sourcegraph instance.
# CHAT_REPLY 2. Enter `repo:sourcegraph/zoekt func tensor` in the search bar.
# CHAT_REPLY 3. Review the search results to locate the function definition.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you still cannot find the `tensor` function, it might be possible that the function is not defined in the codebase you have access to or it might be named differently. In such cases, you might want to check related repositories or dependencies mentioned in the `README.md` file.
