# CHAT_QUESTION what does this regex do? \n/a|e|i|o|u/\n

# CHAT_REPLY The regex `/n/a|e|i|o|u/` matches any of the following characters: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u'. The `|` operator acts as an OR operator, so it matches any one of the specified characters. The `n` at the beginning and the trailing `/n` appear to be extraneous and do not affect the regex pattern itself.
