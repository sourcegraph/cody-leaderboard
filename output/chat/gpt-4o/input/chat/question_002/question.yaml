# CHAT_QUESTION what is squirrel?

# CHAT_REPLY In the provided codebase context, `Squirrel` is an interface that represents a code intelligence API. This interface defines a method `symbolInformation` which takes a file path as a string argument and returns an object of type `CodeIntelligence`. The `CodeIntelligence` interface contains a property `symbols`, which is an array of strings. This suggests that `Squirrel` is designed to provide information about symbols (such as variables, functions, classes, etc.) within a given file.
