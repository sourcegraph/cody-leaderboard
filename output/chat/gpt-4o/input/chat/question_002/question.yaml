# CHAT_QUESTION what is squirrel?

# CHAT_REPLY In the provided codebase context, `Squirrel` is an interface that represents a code intelligence API. This interface defines a method `symbolInformation` that takes a file path as a string argument and returns an object of type `CodeIntelligence`. The `CodeIntelligence` interface, in turn, contains a property `symbols`, which is an array of strings.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Here is the relevant code snippet for reference:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY ```typescript:mocked/enhanced_context/squirrel.ts
# CHAT_REPLY interface CodeIntelligence {
# CHAT_REPLY     symbols: string[]
# CHAT_REPLY }
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY /**
# CHAT_REPLY  * Squirrel is a code intelligence API.
# CHAT_REPLY  */
# CHAT_REPLY interface Squirrel {
# CHAT_REPLY     symbolInformation(file: string): CodeIntelligence
# CHAT_REPLY }
# CHAT_REPLY ```
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY So, `Squirrel` is essentially a contract that specifies how a code intelligence API should behave, particularly in terms of retrieving symbol information from a given file.
