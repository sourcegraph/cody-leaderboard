 question: where do we test the grpc chunker
# CHAT
# CHAT_QUESTION where do we test the grpc chunker

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided codebase context, there is no specific information indicating where the gRPC chunker is tested. The file `mocked/enhanced_context/chunker_test.go` contains a type definition for a `server` struct, but it does not include any test functions or additional context related to testing a gRPC chunker.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To find where the gRPC chunker is tested, you would need to look for test functions in the `chunker_test.go` file or other related test files that specifically test gRPC chunking functionality. Test functions in Go typically start with `Test` and use the `testing` package.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you have access to the full codebase, you can search for test functions that might be testing the gRPC chunker. Look for functions with names that include "chunker" or related terms, and check if they are testing the desired functionality.
