 question: where do we test the grpc chunker
# CHAT
# CHAT_QUESTION where do we test the grpc chunker

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided context, there is no direct indication of where the gRPC chunker is tested. The file `mocked/enhanced_context/chunker_test.go` contains a type definition for a `server` struct, but it doesn't provide any test functions or methods.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To locate the tests for the gRPC chunker, you should look for test functions that likely follow Go's testing conventions. These functions typically start with `Test` and are located in files with the `_test.go` suffix. You might want to search for functions like `TestChunker`, `TestGRPCChunker`, or similar in the test files.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you have access to the entire codebase, you can perform a search for test functions related to the chunker. For example, you can use the following command in the terminal to search for relevant test functions:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY ```sh
# CHAT_REPLY grep -r "func Test" --include \*_test.go
# CHAT_REPLY ```
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Or, if you are using an IDE, you can search for `Test` within the test files to locate the specific tests for the gRPC chunker.
