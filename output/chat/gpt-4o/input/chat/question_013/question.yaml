 question: where do we test the grpc chunker
# CHAT
# CHAT_QUESTION where do we test the grpc chunker

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided codebase context, there is no direct indication of where the gRPC chunker is tested. The snippet from `mocked/enhanced_context/chunker_test.go` only shows the definition of a `server` struct that embeds `grpc_testing.UnimplementedTestServiceServer`, but it does not provide any test functions or methods.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To find where the gRPC chunker is tested, you can try the following steps:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **Search for Test Functions**: Look for test functions in `chunker_test.go` or other test files that might be related to gRPC chunking. Test functions usually start with `Test` and are followed by the name of the functionality being tested.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **Search for gRPC Methods**: Look for methods on the `server` struct that implement gRPC service methods. These methods might be tested in the test files.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. **Search for Keywords**: Search the codebase for keywords like `chunk`, `chunker`, `grpc`, or `TestService` to find relevant test cases.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. **Check Imports and Dependencies**: Check the imports in `chunker_test.go` to see if there are any packages or modules specifically related to gRPC chunking.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you have access to the full codebase, you can use these strategies to locate the tests for the gRPC chunker. If you need further assistance, please provide more context or specific parts of the codebase.
