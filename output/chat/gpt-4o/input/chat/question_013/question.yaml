 question: where do we test the grpc chunker
# CHAT
# CHAT_QUESTION where do we test the grpc chunker

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided context, there isn't enough information to determine where the gRPC chunker is specifically tested. The file `mocked/enhanced_context/chunker_test.go` contains a type definition for a `server` struct, but it doesn't provide any details about the tests themselves.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To find where the gRPC chunker is tested, you can search for test functions within the `chunker_test.go` file or other test files that might be related to gRPC chunking. Typically, test functions in Go are named with the prefix `Test`, such as `TestChunker`, `TestChunking`, or similar.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Here is a general approach to find the relevant tests:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **Search for Test Functions**: Look for functions in `chunker_test.go` that start with `Test`. These functions are standard Go test functions.
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **Check for gRPC Calls**: Within these test functions, look for calls to gRPC methods that might involve chunking.
# CHAT_REPLY 3. **Review Test Files**: If `chunker_test.go` does not contain the relevant tests, check other test files in the same directory or related directories.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you have access to the entire codebase, you can use a search tool to look for keywords like `chunker`, `grpc`, `Test`, etc., to locate the relevant tests.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Would you like me to provide an example of how to structure a test for a gRPC chunker in Go?
