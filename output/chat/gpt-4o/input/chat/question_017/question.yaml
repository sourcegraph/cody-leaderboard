# CHAT_QUESTION Why does this project use the MIT license?

# CHAT_REPLY This project uses the MIT license because it is a permissive open-source license that allows for broad usage and distribution. The MIT license permits users to freely use, modify, and distribute the software, both in private and commercial contexts, with minimal restrictions. This aligns well with the goals of the project, which is to provide a fast and efficient text search engine for source code, encouraging widespread adoption and contribution from the community.
