# CHAT_QUESTION Why does this project use the MIT license?

# CHAT_REPLY The provided codebase context does not explicitly state why the project uses the MIT license. However, the MIT license is a popular open-source license known for its permissiveness and simplicity. Here are some common reasons why projects choose the MIT license:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **Permissiveness**: The MIT license allows users to do almost anything with the project, including using, copying, modifying, merging, publishing, distributing, sublicensing, and selling copies of the software. This can encourage widespread adoption and contribution.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **Simplicity**: The MIT license is short and easy to understand, which can make it more approachable for developers and organizations.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. **Compatibility**: The MIT license is compatible with many other licenses, which can make it easier to integrate with other projects and libraries.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. **Attribution**: The MIT license requires that the original authors be credited, which ensures that contributors receive recognition for their work.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Given that Zoekt is a fast text search engine intended for use with source code, it makes sense to use a permissive license like MIT to encourage adoption and contributions from the open-source community.
