# CHAT_QUESTION What does directory watcher do?

# CHAT_REPLY The `DirectoryWatcher` in your codebase monitors a specified directory for changes to files with the `.zoekt` extension. It keeps track of file modifications and ensures that the latest versions of these files are loaded while older or deleted files are unloaded. It uses the `fsnotify` package to watch for file system events and triggers a scan to update its state accordingly. This mechanism helps in maintaining an up-to-date set of files for further processing or indexing.
