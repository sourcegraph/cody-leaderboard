# CHAT_QUESTION What does directory watcher do?

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided codebase context, there isn't explicit information about a "directory watcher." However, given the context of the codebase, particularly the README.md files, we can infer some potential roles a directory watcher might play in this environment.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY In the context of a codebase like Zoekt, which is a fast text search engine for source code, a directory watcher could serve several purposes:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **Monitoring Changes**: It could monitor directories for changes in the source code files. When a file is added, modified, or deleted, the directory watcher could trigger re-indexing of the affected files to keep the search index up-to-date.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **Automated Indexing**: It could automatically initiate indexing processes when new files or repositories are detected. This would ensure that the search engine always has the latest data without manual intervention.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. **Logging and Notifications**: It could log changes and potentially notify administrators or other systems about updates. This could be useful for auditing purposes or for triggering other automated workflows.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. **Performance Optimization**: By keeping track of changes incrementally, it could help optimize the performance of the search engine by avoiding the need to re-index the entire codebase from scratch.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To get a precise understanding of what a directory watcher does in this specific codebase, you would typically look for files or modules related to file system monitoring, indexing triggers, or automated update processes. These might be implemented in Go, given the context of the provided files. Look for terms like "watcher," "monitor," "file system," or "indexing" in the codebase.
