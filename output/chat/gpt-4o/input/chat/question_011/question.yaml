# CHAT_QUESTION What does directory watcher do?

# CHAT_REPLY The `DirectoryWatcher` in the provided codebase is responsible for monitoring a directory for changes to files with the `.zoekt` extension. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of its functionality:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **Initialization**:
# CHAT_REPLY    - The `newDirectoryWatcher` function initializes a new `DirectoryWatcher` instance, setting up the directory to watch, a map to track file modification timestamps, and a loader to handle loading and dropping files.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **Scanning**:
# CHAT_REPLY    - The `scan` method scans the specified directory for files with the `.zoekt` extension.
# CHAT_REPLY    - It filters out files based on their version, ensuring that only files with a version less than or equal to the current and next index format versions are considered.
# CHAT_REPLY    - It updates the `timestamps` map with the modification times of the files and their associated metadata files.
# CHAT_REPLY    - It identifies new or modified files to load and files that have been deleted to drop.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. **Watching**:
# CHAT_REPLY    - The `watch` method sets up a file system watcher using the `fsnotify` package to monitor the directory for changes.
# CHAT_REPLY    - It listens for file system events and triggers a scan when changes are detected.
# CHAT_REPLY    - It handles errors from the watcher and ensures the watcher is properly closed when the `DirectoryWatcher` is stopped.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. **Loading and Dropping Files**:
# CHAT_REPLY    - The `loader` interface defines methods for loading and dropping files. The `DirectoryWatcher` uses this loader to manage the files based on the results of the scan.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. **Concurrency and Synchronization**:
# CHAT_REPLY    - The `DirectoryWatcher` uses channels and synchronization primitives (like `sync.Once`) to manage the lifecycle of the watcher, ensuring it starts and stops correctly.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 6. **Error Handling and Logging**:
# CHAT_REPLY    - The `DirectoryWatcher` logs errors encountered during scanning and watching, providing visibility into issues that may arise.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY In summary, the `DirectoryWatcher` is a utility that continuously monitors a directory for changes to `.zoekt` files, ensuring that new or modified files are loaded and deleted files are dropped, keeping the system in sync with the current state of the directory.
