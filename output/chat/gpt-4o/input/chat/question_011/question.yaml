# CHAT_QUESTION What does directory watcher do?

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided codebase context, there is no explicit mention of a "directory watcher" or its functionality. However, given the context of the `zoekt` project, which is a fast text search engine intended for use with source code, a directory watcher could be inferred to be a component that monitors directories for changes (such as file modifications, additions, or deletions) and triggers re-indexing of the source code files to keep the search index up to date.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY In many search engine or indexing systems, a directory watcher is responsible for:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **Monitoring Changes**: Keeping an eye on specified directories to detect changes in real-time.
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **Triggering Re-indexing**: When changes are detected, the directory watcher would trigger the re-indexing process to update the search index with the latest content.
# CHAT_REPLY 3. **Maintaining Index Consistency**: Ensuring that the search index remains consistent with the actual state of the files in the monitored directories.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you need more specific details about the implementation or functionality of a directory watcher within this codebase, you might need to look at the actual implementation files or documentation related to file monitoring or indexing processes.
