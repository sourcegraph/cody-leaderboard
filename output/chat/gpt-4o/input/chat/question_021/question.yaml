# CHAT_QUESTION how do goroutines work?

# CHAT_REPLY Goroutines are a fundamental feature in Go that allow you to run functions concurrently. They are lightweight, managed by the Go runtime, and provide a simple way to achieve concurrency in Go programs. Here's a detailed explanation of how goroutines work:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY ### Creating a Goroutine
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To start a new goroutine, you use the `go` keyword followed by a function call. For example:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY ```go
# CHAT_REPLY go someFunction()
# CHAT_REPLY ```
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY This line of code will start `someFunction` in a new goroutine, allowing it to run concurrently with the calling function.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY ### Characteristics of Goroutines
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **Lightweight**: Goroutines are much lighter than traditional threads. The initial stack size of a goroutine is small (a few kilobytes), and it grows and shrinks as needed.
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **Managed by the Go Runtime**: The Go runtime manages the scheduling of goroutines. It multiplexes thousands of goroutines onto a smaller number of OS threads.
# CHAT_REPLY 3. **Non-blocking**: When a goroutine performs a blocking operation, such as waiting for I/O, the Go runtime can schedule another goroutine to run on the same OS thread.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY ### Example
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Here's a simple example of using goroutines:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY ```go
# CHAT_REPLY package main
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY import (
# CHAT_REPLY 	"fmt"
# CHAT_REPLY 	"time"
# CHAT_REPLY )
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY func sayHello() {
# CHAT_REPLY 	for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
# CHAT_REPLY 		fmt.Println("Hello")
# CHAT_REPLY 		time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
# CHAT_REPLY 	}
# CHAT_REPLY }
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY func main() {
# CHAT_REPLY 	go sayHello() // Start sayHello in a new goroutine
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 	for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
# CHAT_REPLY 		fmt.Println("World")
# CHAT_REPLY 		time.Sleep(200 * time.Millisecond)
# CHAT_REPLY 	}
# CHAT_REPLY }
# CHAT_REPLY ```
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY In this example, `sayHello` runs concurrently with the `main` function. The output will interleave "Hello" and "World" because both functions are running concurrently.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY ### Synchronization
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Goroutines often need to communicate or synchronize with each other. Go provides several mechanisms for this:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **Channels**: Channels are a way for goroutines to communicate with each other and synchronize their execution. You can send values from one goroutine to another using channels.
# CHAT_REPLY    
# CHAT_REPLY    ```go
# CHAT_REPLY    package main
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY    import "fmt"
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY    func main() {
# CHAT_REPLY        ch := make(chan string)
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY        go func() {
# CHAT_REPLY            ch <- "Hello from goroutine"
# CHAT_REPLY        }()
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY        msg := <-ch
# CHAT_REPLY        fmt.Println(msg)
# CHAT_REPLY    }
# CHAT_REPLY    ```
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **WaitGroups**: The `sync.WaitGroup` type provides a way to wait for a collection of goroutines to finish executing.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY    ```go
# CHAT_REPLY    package main
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY    import (
# CHAT_REPLY        "fmt"
# CHAT_REPLY        "sync"
# CHAT_REPLY    )
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY    func worker(id int, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
# CHAT_REPLY        defer wg.Done()
# CHAT_REPLY        fmt.Printf("Worker %d starting\n", id)
# CHAT_REPLY        // Simulate work
# CHAT_REPLY        fmt.Printf("Worker %d done\n", id)
# CHAT_REPLY    }
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY    func main() {
# CHAT_REPLY        var wg sync.WaitGroup
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY        for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
# CHAT_REPLY            wg.Add(1)
# CHAT_REPLY            go worker(i, &wg)
# CHAT_REPLY        }
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY        wg.Wait()
# CHAT_REPLY    }
# CHAT_REPLY    ```
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY ### Error Handling
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Error handling in goroutines can be tricky because errors need to be communicated back to the main goroutine or another goroutine. This is often done using channels.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY ### Example from Provided Codebase
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY In the provided codebase, there is an example of using a goroutine to update an actor outside the request hotpath:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY ```go
# CHAT_REPLY go func() {
# CHAT_REPLY     if updateErr := u.actor.Update(context.WithoutCancel(ctx)); updateErr != nil &&
# CHAT_REPLY         !IsErrActorRecentlyUpdated(updateErr) {
# CHAT_REPLY         u.logger.Warn("unexpected error updating actor",
# CHAT_REPLY             log.Error(updateErr),
# CHAT_REPLY             log.NamedError("originalError", err))
# CHAT_REPLY     }
# CHAT_REPLY }()
# CHAT_REPLY ```
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Here, the `Update` method of the `actor` is called in a new goroutine. This allows the update to happen concurrently without blocking the main execution flow.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY ### Summary
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY - Goroutines are lightweight, managed by the Go runtime, and provide a simple way to achieve concurrency.
# CHAT_REPLY - They are created using the `go` keyword.
# CHAT_REPLY - Synchronization and communication between goroutines can be achieved using channels and other synchronization primitives like `sync.WaitGroup`.
# CHAT_REPLY - Error handling in goroutines often involves communicating errors back to other goroutines using channels.
