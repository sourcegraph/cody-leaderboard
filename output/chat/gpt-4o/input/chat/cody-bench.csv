They are more versatile than arrays because they are dynamically sized. Here are some key points about slices in Go:

1. **Definition and Initialization**:
   - A slice is a descriptor of an array segment. It consists of a pointer to the array, the length of the segment, and its capacity (the maximum length up to which it can grow).
   - You can create a slice using the `make` function, by slicing an array, or by using a slice literal.

   ```go
   // Using make function
   s := make([]int, 5) // creates a slice of length 5 and capacity 5

   // Slicing an array
   arr := [5]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
   s := arr[1:4] // creates a slice [2, 3, 4]

   // Slice literal
   s := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
   ```

2. **Length and Capacity**:
   - The length of a slice is the number of elements it contains.
   - The capacity of a slice is the number of elements in the underlying array, counting from the first element in the slice.

   ```go
   s := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
   fmt.Println(len(s)) // Output: 5
   fmt.Println(cap(s)) // Output: 5
   ```

3. **Appending to Slices**:
   - You can add elements to a slice using the `append` function. If the slice has enough capacity, the underlying array is reused. If not, a new array is allocated.

   ```go
   s := []int{1, 2, 3}
   s = append(s, 4, 5)
   fmt.Println(s) // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   ```

4. **Copying Slices**:
   - You can copy elements from one slice to another using the `copy` function.

   ```go
   src := []int{1, 2, 3}
   dst := make([]int, len(src))
   copy(dst, src)
   fmt.Println(dst) // Output: [1, 2, 3]
   ```

5. **Slicing Slices**:
   - You can create a new slice from an existing slice by specifying a range.

   ```go
   s := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
   t := s[1:4] // creates a slice [2, 3, 4]
   ```

6. **Zero Value**:
   - The zero value of a slice is `nil`. A `nil` slice has a length and capacity of 0 and no underlying array.

   ```go
   var s []int
   fmt.Println(s == nil) // Output: true
   ```

7. **Iterating Over Slices**:
   - You can iterate over the elements of a slice using a `for` loop.

   ```go
   s := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
   for i, v := range s {
       fmt.Println(i, v)
   }
   ```

In the provided codebase context, the `slices` package is used, which is part of the Go standard library. It provides utility functions for working with slices, such as `slices.Contains`, which checks if a slice contains a specific element.

```go
if slices.Contains(prefixedMasterAllowlist, val) {
    result = append(result, val)
}
```

This code checks if `val` is present in `prefixedMasterAllowlist` and appends it to the `result` slice if it is.",how do slices work in go?,,,,,,,,,,,

### File Overview

The `limit.go` file defines functions and types related to limiting and truncating search results in Zoekt. The main functionalities include sorting and truncating file matches based on search options, and enforcing document and match display limits.

### Key Components

1. **SortAndTruncateFiles Function**
   - This function sorts and truncates file matches based on the provided search options.
   - It uses `SortFiles` to sort the files and `NewDisplayTruncator` to truncate them.

2. **DisplayTruncator Type**
   - A function type that enforces document and match display limits by truncating and mutating file matches.
   - It returns truncated file matches and a boolean indicating if more matches are available.

3. **NewDisplayTruncator Function**
   - Creates a `DisplayTruncator` based on the provided search options.
   - It checks if there are any limits to enforce and returns a truncator function accordingly.

4. **limitMatches Function**
   - Limits the number of matches in the given file matches based on the provided limit and chunk matches option.
   - It uses either `limitChunkMatches` or `limitLineMatches` based on the chunk matches option.

5. **limitChunkMatches Function**
   - Limits the number of chunk matches in a given file match.
   - It adjusts the content, ranges, and symbol info fields of the chunk matches to enforce the limit.

6. **limitLineMatches Function**
   - Limits the number of line matches in a given file match.
   - It truncates the line fragments to enforce the limit.

To locate the `tensor` function within the Zoekt repository, you would typically search through the codebase using a search tool or by manually inspecting the files.

Given that I don't have access to the entire codebase, I recommend using the following methods to find the `tensor` function:

1. **Using `grep` (or similar command-line tools):**
   ```sh
   grep -r ""func tensor"" /path/to/zoekt/repo
   ```

2. **Using an IDE or text editor with search functionality:**
   - Open the Zoekt repository in your preferred IDE (e.g., VSCode, IntelliJ).
   - Use the ""Find in Files"" feature to search for `func tensor`.

3. **Using Sourcegraph:**
   - If the repository is indexed by Sourcegraph, you can use Sourcegraph's search functionality to find the definition of the `tensor` function.

Since I only have access to the provided codebase context, which does not include the content of `src/agent.go`, I cannot directly explain the logic in that file.

However, I can guide you on how to approach understanding the logic in `src/agent.go`:

1. **Identify the Agents**: Look for the definition of agents in the file. This could be a struct or a type that represents an agent.

2. **Agent Methods**: Check for methods associated with the agent type. These methods will define the behavior and interactions of the agents.

3. **Ranking Mechanism**: Look for any functions or methods that involve ranking. This could involve sorting, scoring, or prioritizing agents based on certain criteria.

4. **Interactions**: Examine how agents interact with each other and with the ranking mechanism. This could involve communication between agents, updating ranks, or responding to rank changes.

5. **Comments and Documentation**: Pay attention to any comments or documentation within the code. These can provide valuable insights into the intended logic and functionality.

They are lightweight, managed by the Go runtime, and allow you to efficiently handle multiple tasks simultaneously. Here's a basic overview of how goroutines work:

### Creating a Goroutine
To create a goroutine, you use the `go` keyword followed by a function call. For example:

```go
package main

import (
    ""fmt""
    ""time""
)

func sayHello() {
    fmt.Println(""Hello, World!"")
}

func main() {
    go sayHello() // This starts a new goroutine
    time.Sleep(1 * time.Second) // Sleep to allow the goroutine to complete
}
```

In this example, `sayHello` is executed in a new goroutine. The `main` function continues to execute concurrently. The `time.Sleep` call is used to prevent the program from exiting before the goroutine has a chance to run.

### Goroutine Characteristics
1. **Lightweight**: Goroutines are much lighter than traditional threads. The Go runtime manages them, and they have a small initial stack size that grows and shrinks as needed.
2. **Managed by Go Runtime**: The Go scheduler handles the execution of goroutines, distributing them across available CPU cores.
3. **Concurrency**: Goroutines enable concurrent programming, allowing multiple tasks to run simultaneously.

### Synchronization
To coordinate between goroutines, Go provides several synchronization primitives, such as channels, mutexes, and wait groups.

#### Channels
Channels are used to communicate between goroutines safely. They can be used to send and receive values.

```go
package main

import (
    ""fmt""
)

func sayHello(done chan bool) {
    fmt.Println(""Hello, World!"")
    done <- true // Signal that the function is done
}

func main() {
    done := make(chan bool)
    go sayHello(done)
    <-done // Wait for the signal
}
```

#### Wait Groups
Wait groups are used to wait for a collection of goroutines to finish executing.

```go
package main

import (
    ""fmt""
    ""sync""
)

func sayHello(wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
    defer wg.Done() // Signal that the goroutine is done
    fmt.Println(""Hello, World!"")
}

func main() {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    wg.Add(1) // Add a goroutine to the wait group
    go sayHello(&wg)
    wg.Wait() // Wait for all goroutines to finish
}
```

### Error Handling
Error handling in goroutines can be done through channels or other synchronization mechanisms. For example, you can send errors through a channel and handle them in the main function.

```go
package main

import (
    ""errors""
    ""fmt""
)

func doWork(errChan chan error) {
    // Simulate an error
    errChan <- errors.New(""something went wrong"")
}

func main() {
    errChan := make(chan error)
    go doWork(errChan)
    err := <-errChan
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(""Error:"", err)
    }
}
```

### Conclusion
Goroutines are a powerful feature in Go that enable concurrent programming with ease. They are lightweight, managed by the Go runtime, and can be synchronized using channels, wait groups, and other primitives. Understanding how to use goroutines effectively can help you build efficient and scalable applications.",how do goroutines work?,,,,,,,,,,,

It primarily deals with sorting and truncating file matches based on specified search options. Here are the key functionalities it provides:

1. **Sorting and Truncating Files:**
   - The `SortAndTruncateFiles` function sorts a list of `FileMatch` objects and then truncates them based on the search options provided.

2. **Display Truncator:**
   - The `DisplayTruncator` type is a function that enforces document and match display limits by truncating and mutating the list of `FileMatch` objects. It returns the truncated list and a boolean indicating whether there are more items to process.
   - The `NewDisplayTruncator` function creates a `DisplayTruncator` based on the limits specified in the `SearchOptions`. If no limits are specified, it returns a no-op truncator.

3. **Limiting Matches:**
   - The `limitMatches` function limits the number of matches in the given `FileMatch` objects based on the specified limit and whether chunk matches or line matches should be considered.
   - The `limitChunkMatches` function limits the number of chunk matches in a `FileMatch`, adjusting the content, ranges, and symbol information accordingly.
   - The `limitLineMatches` function limits the number of line matches in a `FileMatch`, adjusting the line fragments accordingly.

Overall, the file provides utilities for managing and enforcing display limits on search results, ensuring that the number of documents and matches displayed does not exceed the specified limits.",what does @limit.go do?,,,,,,,,,,,
