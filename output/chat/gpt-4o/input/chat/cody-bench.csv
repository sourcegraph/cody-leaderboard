### Definition and Declaration

A slice is a descriptor for a contiguous segment of an underlying array and provides much more powerful and flexible operations than arrays. A slice is defined by three components:
- **Pointer**: Points to the first element of the array that is accessible through the slice.
- **Length**: The number of elements in the slice.
- **Capacity**: The number of elements in the underlying array, starting from the element the slice points to.

You can declare a slice in several ways:

1. **Using a slice literal**:
    ```go
    s := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    ```

2. **Using the `make` function**:
    ```go
    s := make([]int, 5) // creates a slice of length 5 and capacity 5
    s := make([]int, 5, 10) // creates a slice of length 5 and capacity 10
    ```

3. **Slicing an array or another slice**:
    ```go
    arr := [5]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    s := arr[1:4] // creates a slice [2, 3, 4]
    ```

### Operations on Slices

1. **Accessing elements**:
    ```go
    s := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    fmt.Println(s[0]) // prints 1
    ```

2. **Modifying elements**:
    ```go
    s := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    s[0] = 10
    fmt.Println(s) // prints [10, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    ```

3. **Appending elements**:
    ```go
    s := []int{1, 2, 3}
    s = append(s, 4, 5)
    fmt.Println(s) // prints [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    ```

4. **Copying slices**:
    ```go
    src := []int{1, 2, 3}
    dst := make([]int, len(src))
    copy(dst, src)
    fmt.Println(dst) // prints [1, 2, 3]
    ```

### Slicing a Slice

You can create a new slice from an existing slice:
```go
s := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
s1 := s[1:4] // creates a slice [2, 3, 4]
```

### Length and Capacity

- **Length**: The number of elements in the slice, accessible using `len` function.
- **Capacity**: The number of elements in the underlying array, starting from the element the slice points to, accessible using `cap` function.

```go
s := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
fmt.Println(len(s)) // prints 5
fmt.Println(cap(s)) // prints 5

s1 := s[1:4]
fmt.Println(len(s1)) // prints 3
fmt.Println(cap(s1)) // prints 4
```

### Zero Value

The zero value of a slice is `nil`. A `nil` slice has a length and capacity of 0 and has no underlying array.

```go
var s []int
fmt.Println(s == nil) // prints true
fmt.Println(len(s)) // prints 0
fmt.Println(cap(s)) // prints 0
```

### Example from the Codebase

In the provided codebase context, the `slices` package is used, which likely provides utility functions for working with slices. For example, the `slices.Contains` function is used to check if a slice contains a specific element:

```go
if slices.Contains(prefixedMasterAllowlist, val) {
    result = append(result, val)
}
```

This line checks if `val` is in `prefixedMasterAllowlist` and, if so, appends it to the `result` slice.

### Conclusion

Slices in Go are a powerful abstraction over arrays, providing dynamic resizing, easy slicing, and a rich set of operations. They are widely used in Go programming for their flexibility and efficiency.",how do slices work in go?,,,,,,,,,,,

1. **Automated Testing**: Running tests automatically when code files are changed.
2. **Live Reloading**: Automatically reloading a web page or application when source files are modified.
3. **Backup and Sync**: Triggering backup or synchronization processes when files are added or changed.
4. **Logging and Auditing**: Keeping a log of changes to files for security or auditing purposes.
5. **Build Systems**: Triggering build processes when source files are updated.

1. **Open Sourcegraph**: Navigate to your Sourcegraph instance.
2. **Search Query**: Use the search bar to enter the following query:
   ```
   repo:zoekt function:tensor
   ```
   This will search for the definition of the `tensor` function within the Zoekt repository.

3. **Review Results**: Look through the search results to find the exact location of the `tensor` function.

If you do not have access to Sourcegraph, you can also use command-line tools like `grep` to search through the codebase locally. For example:

```sh
grep -r ""func tensor"" /path/to/zoekt/repo
```

This command will recursively search for the `tensor` function definition in the Zoekt repository directory.",See zoekt repo find location of tensor function,,,,,,,,,,,

They are lightweight, managed by the Go runtime, and provide a simple way to achieve concurrency in Go programs. Here's a detailed explanation of how goroutines work:

### Creating a Goroutine

To start a new goroutine, you use the `go` keyword followed by a function call. For example:

```go
go someFunction()
```

This line of code will start `someFunction` in a new goroutine, allowing it to run concurrently with the calling function.

### Characteristics of Goroutines

1. **Lightweight**: Goroutines are much lighter than traditional threads. The initial stack size of a goroutine is small (a few kilobytes), and it grows and shrinks as needed.
2. **Managed by the Go Runtime**: The Go runtime manages the scheduling of goroutines. It multiplexes thousands of goroutines onto a smaller number of OS threads.
3. **Non-blocking**: When a goroutine performs a blocking operation, such as waiting for I/O, the Go runtime can schedule another goroutine to run on the same OS thread.

### Example

Here's a simple example of using goroutines:

```go
package main

import (
	""fmt""
	""time""
)

func sayHello() {
	for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
		fmt.Println(""Hello"")
		time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
	}
}

func main() {
	go sayHello() // Start sayHello in a new goroutine

	for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
		fmt.Println(""World"")
		time.Sleep(200 * time.Millisecond)
	}
}
```

In this example, `sayHello` runs concurrently with the `main` function. The output will interleave ""Hello"" and ""World"" because both functions are running concurrently.

### Synchronization

Goroutines often need to communicate or synchronize with each other. Go provides several mechanisms for this:

1. **Channels**: Channels are a way for goroutines to communicate with each other and synchronize their execution. You can send values from one goroutine to another using channels.
   
   ```go
   package main

   import ""fmt""

   func main() {
       ch := make(chan string)

       go func() {
           ch <- ""Hello from goroutine""
       }()

       msg := <-ch
       fmt.Println(msg)
   }
   ```

2. **WaitGroups**: The `sync.WaitGroup` type provides a way to wait for a collection of goroutines to finish executing.

   ```go
   package main

   import (
       ""fmt""
       ""sync""
   )

   func worker(id int, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
       defer wg.Done()
       fmt.Printf(""Worker %d starting\n"", id)
       // Simulate work
       fmt.Printf(""Worker %d done\n"", id)
   }

   func main() {
       var wg sync.WaitGroup

       for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
           wg.Add(1)
           go worker(i, &wg)
       }

       wg.Wait()
   }
   ```

### Error Handling

Error handling in goroutines can be tricky because errors need to be communicated back to the main goroutine or another goroutine. This is often done using channels.

### Example from Provided Codebase

In the provided codebase, there is an example of using a goroutine to update an actor outside the request hotpath:

```go
go func() {
    if updateErr := u.actor.Update(context.WithoutCancel(ctx)); updateErr != nil &&
        !IsErrActorRecentlyUpdated(updateErr) {
        u.logger.Warn(""unexpected error updating actor"",
            log.Error(updateErr),
            log.NamedError(""originalError"", err))
    }
}()
```

Here, the `Update` method of the `actor` is called in a new goroutine. This allows the update to happen concurrently without blocking the main execution flow.

### Summary

- Goroutines are lightweight, managed by the Go runtime, and provide a simple way to achieve concurrency.
- They are created using the `go` keyword.
- Synchronization and communication between goroutines can be achieved using channels and other synchronization primitives like `sync.WaitGroup`.
- Error handling in goroutines often involves communicating errors back to other goroutines using channels.",how do goroutines work?,,,,,,,,,,,

Here's a breakdown of its main components and functionality:

1. **RateLimit Structure**:
   - Defines the rate limit configuration for an actor, including allowed models, limit, interval, and concurrency settings.
   - `NewRateLimitWithPercentageConcurrency`: A constructor function that creates a `RateLimit` instance with concurrency limits based on a percentage of the daily limit.
   - `IsValid`: A method to check if the rate limit configuration is valid.
   - `EvaluateAllowedModels`: A method to determine the intersection of a master allowlist and the actor's allowlist.

2. **Concurrency Limiter**:
   - `concurrencyLimiter`: A structure that implements concurrency control using a Redis store.
   - `TryAcquire`: A method to attempt to acquire a concurrency slot. If the limit is exceeded, it returns an error with retry information.
   - `Usage`: A method to get the current usage of the concurrency limit.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - `ErrConcurrencyLimitExceeded`: A custom error type for when the concurrency limit is exceeded. It includes methods to generate error messages and write HTTP responses.

4. **Update on Error Limiter**:
   - `updateOnErrorLimiter`: A structure that wraps another limiter and attempts to update the actor's access if certain errors occur.
   - `TryAcquire`: A method that tries to acquire a slot and updates the actor's access if needed.
   - `Usage`: A method to get the current usage of the wrapped limiter.

Overall, the file provides mechanisms to enforce rate limits and concurrency controls, handle errors, and update actor access as needed.",what does @limit.go do?,,,,,,,,,,,
