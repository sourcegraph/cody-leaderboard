 question: Explain the logic in src/agent.go, particularly how agents interact with ranking

# CHAT_QUESTION Explain the logic in src/agent.go, particularly how agents interact with ranking

# CHAT_REPLY I apologize, but I don't have access to the contents of a file named "src/agent.go" in the provided codebase context. The context you shared is the README.md file, which doesn't contain specific code or logic related to agents or ranking.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The README.md file provides an overview of Zoekt, a fast text search engine for source code, but it doesn't include detailed information about agents or ranking logic.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you have access to the "src/agent.go" file and can provide its contents, I'd be happy to explain the logic it contains. Without seeing the actual code, I can't make any assumptions or provide explanations about how agents interact with ranking in this specific implementation.
