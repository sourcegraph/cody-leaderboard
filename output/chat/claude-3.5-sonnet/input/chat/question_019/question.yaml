# CHAT_QUESTION Explain the logic in src/agent.go, particularly how agents interact with ranking

# CHAT_REPLY Certainly! I'd be happy to explain the logic in src/agent.go, particularly how agents interact with ranking.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY In src/agent.go, the code defines an Agent struct that represents a search agent. These agents are responsible for performing searches across shards and aggregating results. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The key interaction with ranking occurs in the Search method of the Agent. Here's how it works:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. The agent receives a query and search options.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. It determines which shards to search based on the query and available shards.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. For each shard, the agent spawns a goroutine to perform the search.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. As results come in from each shard, they are collected and merged.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. The ranking comes into play during this merging process. The agent uses a priority queue to maintain the top-ranked results across all shards.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 6. The ranking of individual results is determined by the Rank field of each FileMatch. This Rank is calculated within each shard based on various factors like term frequency, document score, and symbol matches.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 7. The priority queue ensures that the highest-ranked results across all shards bubble up to the top.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 8. Finally, the agent returns the top-ranked results based on the specified limit in the search options.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY This approach allows the agent to efficiently handle large-scale searches across multiple shards while maintaining a ranking system that surfaces the most relevant results. The ranking logic itself is primarily implemented within the shards, but the agent's role is crucial in aggregating and presenting the final ranked results.
