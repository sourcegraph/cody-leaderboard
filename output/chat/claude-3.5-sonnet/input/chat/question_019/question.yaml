 question: Explain the logic in src/agent.go, particularly how agents interact with ranking
# CHAT
# CHAT_REPLY I apologize, but I cannot explain the logic in src/agent.go or how agents interact with ranking based on the provided codebase context. The context you've given is from a file named "watcher.go" in the "question_019" directory, and it doesn't contain any information about agents or ranking.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The provided code snippet is about a function called `GetServiceConnectionValueAndRestartOnChange` which deals with service connection configuration and restarting on changes. It doesn't contain any information related to agents or ranking.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To answer your question accurately, I would need access to the content of src/agent.go and any other relevant files that describe agent interactions and ranking logic. Without that information, I can't make any statements about the requested topic.

   - watcher.go
