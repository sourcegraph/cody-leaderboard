# CHAT_QUESTION Explain the logic in src/agent.go, particularly how agents interact with ranking

# CHAT_REPLY I'd be happy to explain the logic in src/agent.go, particularly regarding how agents interact with ranking. However, I don't see a src/agent.go file in the provided codebase context. The context appears to be a README file that gives an overview of the Zoekt search engine project, but doesn't contain specific code implementations.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The README does mention that Zoekt uses ranking for search results, and that installing Universal ctags can improve ranking. However, without access to the specific src/agent.go file, I can't provide details on how agents might interact with the ranking system.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you have additional code files or context you'd like me to analyze, please provide them and I'd be glad to take a look. Otherwise, I can discuss the general search and indexing capabilities of Zoekt based on the information in the README.
