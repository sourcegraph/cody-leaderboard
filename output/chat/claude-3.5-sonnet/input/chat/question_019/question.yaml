 question: Explain the logic in src/agent.go, particularly how agents interact with ranking

# CHAT_QUESTION Explain the logic in src/agent.go, particularly how agents interact with ranking

# CHAT_REPLY I apologize, but I don't have access to the contents of a file named "src/agent.go" in the provided codebase context. The context you've shared is the README.md file, which doesn't contain specific code implementations or details about agents and ranking.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The README.md file provides an overview of Zoekt, which is a fast text search engine intended for use with source code. It includes instructions for installation, indexing, and searching, but it doesn't go into the implementation details of agents or ranking logic.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you have access to the "src/agent.go" file and can provide its contents, I'd be happy to explain the logic related to agents and ranking. Without seeing the actual code, I can't provide specific information about how agents interact with ranking in this particular implementation.
