 question: where do we test the grpc chunker
# CHAT
# CHAT_QUESTION where do we test the grpc chunker

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided codebase context, I don't have enough information to determine where the gRPC chunker is tested. The context you've shared includes a README file and a small snippet from a test file, but neither of these explicitly mention testing a gRPC chunker.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The test file snippet you provided (`chunker_test.go`) defines a `server` struct that embeds `grpc_testing.UnimplementedTestServiceServer`, which suggests it might be part of a gRPC test setup. However, this alone doesn't indicate where or how a gRPC chunker is tested.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To accurately answer where the gRPC chunker is tested, we would need to see more of the codebase, particularly test files that specifically deal with chunking in a gRPC context. Without that information, I cannot make any definitive statements about where the gRPC chunker is tested in this codebase.

 files:
   - ../mocked/codebase_context/README.md
   - ../mocked/enhanced_context/chunker_test.go
