 question: where do we test the grpc chunker

# CHAT_QUESTION where do we test the grpc chunker

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the codebase context provided, it appears that the grpc chunker tests are likely located in the file "chunker_test.go". The snippet you've shown defines a server struct that embeds the UnimplementedTestServiceServer, which is typically used in gRPC testing scenarios. While we don't see the actual test functions in this snippet, it's a strong indication that this file contains tests related to the gRPC chunker functionality. The "_test.go" suffix in the filename also follows the Go convention for test files.
