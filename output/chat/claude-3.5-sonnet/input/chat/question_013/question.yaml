 question: where do we test the grpc chunker
# CHAT
# CHAT_QUESTION where do we test the grpc chunker

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided codebase context, I don't see specific tests for a gRPC chunker in the given snippets. The file `chunker_test.go` appears to contain a server struct that embeds an unimplemented gRPC test service, but it doesn't show any actual test implementations for a chunker.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To find where the gRPC chunker is tested, we would need to look at other test files in the codebase, particularly those related to gRPC functionality or streaming. It's possible that chunker tests exist in other files not shown in the current context.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you'd like to locate the specific tests for the gRPC chunker, we could search for files with names like `grpc_chunker_test.go`, `stream_test.go`, or similar in the project's test directories.
