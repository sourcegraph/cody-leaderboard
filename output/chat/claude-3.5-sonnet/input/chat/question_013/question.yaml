 question: where do we test the grpc chunker
# CHAT
# CHAT_QUESTION where do we test the grpc chunker

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided codebase context, I don't see any specific tests for a gRPC chunker in the given information. The context includes a README file and a small snippet from a test file, but neither of these directly mention or show tests for a gRPC chunker.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The snippet from `chunker_test.go` shows a struct definition for a server that embeds `grpc_testing.UnimplementedTestServiceServer`, which suggests that this file might be related to gRPC testing. However, without seeing the rest of the file or other related files, I can't confirm if or where the gRPC chunker is specifically tested.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To find where the gRPC chunker is tested, you would typically look for:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. Test files with names like `chunker_test.go` or `grpc_chunker_test.go`
# CHAT_REPLY 2. Test functions within these files, possibly with names containing "Chunker" or "Chunk"
# CHAT_REPLY 3. Any benchmarks or examples related to chunking in gRPC contexts
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you need more specific information about where the gRPC chunker is tested, you might want to search through the codebase for files with these naming patterns or look for test functions that specifically mention chunking functionality.
