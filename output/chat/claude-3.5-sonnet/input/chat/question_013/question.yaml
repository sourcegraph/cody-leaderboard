 question: where do we test the grpc chunker
# CHAT
# CHAT_QUESTION where do we test the grpc chunker

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided codebase context, I don't see specific tests for a gRPC chunker in the given snippets. However, the context includes a `server` struct that embeds `grpc_testing.UnimplementedTestServiceServer`, which suggests that there may be gRPC-related tests elsewhere in the codebase.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To find tests for the gRPC chunker, you might want to look for:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. Files with names like `chunker_test.go` or `grpc_chunker_test.go`
# CHAT_REPLY 2. Test functions that include "Chunker" or "GRPC" in their names
# CHAT_REPLY 3. Test suites that focus on gRPC functionality
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you can't find specific chunker tests, it's possible that:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. The chunker functionality is tested as part of larger integration tests
# CHAT_REPLY 2. The tests are located in a different package or directory
# CHAT_REPLY 3. The chunker tests haven't been implemented yet
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To get a more accurate answer, you may need to search through the entire codebase or check the test coverage reports if available.
