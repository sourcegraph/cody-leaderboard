 question: where do we test the grpc chunker
# CHAT
# CHAT_QUESTION where do we test the grpc chunker

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided codebase context, I don't see any specific tests for a gRPC chunker in the given information. The context includes a README file and a small snippet from a test file, but neither of these contain tests for a gRPC chunker.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The snippet from `chunker_test.go` only shows a struct definition for a server that implements the `UnimplementedTestServiceServer` from the `grpc_testing` package. This suggests that there might be gRPC-related tests in this file, but we don't have enough information to determine if it specifically tests a gRPC chunker.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To find where the gRPC chunker is tested, we would need to:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. Look for files with names like `chunker_test.go`, `grpc_chunker_test.go`, or similar.
# CHAT_REPLY 2. Search for test functions (functions starting with `Test`) that involve chunking or streaming gRPC operations.
# CHAT_REPLY 3. Check the contents of these test functions for assertions related to chunking behavior.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Without more context from the codebase, especially the actual test implementations, I can't provide a definitive answer about where the gRPC chunker is tested.
