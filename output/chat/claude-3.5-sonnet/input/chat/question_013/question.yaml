 question: where do we test the grpc chunker

# CHAT_QUESTION where do we test the grpc chunker

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided context, it appears that the GRPC chunker tests are not directly visible in the given code snippets. However, I can provide some general guidance on where and how GRPC chunker tests are typically implemented:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. Test file location: GRPC chunker tests are usually located in a separate test file, often named something like `chunker_test.go` or `grpc_chunker_test.go`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. Test package: These tests would typically be in the same package as the chunker implementation, or in a separate test package (e.g., `package chunker_test`).
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. Test structure: You'd likely find test functions prefixed with `Test`, such as `TestChunkerSend`, `TestChunkerReceive`, or `TestChunkerEndToEnd`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. Mock server: The `server` struct you've shown, which embeds `grpc_testing.UnimplementedTestServiceServer`, suggests that there might be some GRPC testing infrastructure in place. This could be used in chunker tests to simulate real GRPC communication.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. Test scenarios: Typical test cases would include sending large messages that need chunking, receiving chunked messages, handling edge cases (like empty messages or very large chunks), and testing error conditions.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 6. Benchmarks: You might also find benchmark functions (prefixed with `Benchmark`) to measure the performance of the chunker.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To locate the actual tests, you'd want to search for files with names containing "chunker" and "test", and look for functions starting with "Test" that involve GRPC message chunking operations.
