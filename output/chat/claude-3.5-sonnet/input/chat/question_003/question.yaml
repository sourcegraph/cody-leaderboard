# CHAT_QUESTION What code do you have access to?

# CHAT_REPLY I have access to the README.md file for the Zoekt project, which is a fast text search engine intended for use with source code. This file provides an overview of Zoekt, including instructions for downloading, indexing, searching, and installation. It also includes information about the search service, symbol search capabilities, and details about this particular fork of the original Google project.
