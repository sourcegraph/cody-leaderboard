# CHAT_QUESTION What code do you have access to?

# CHAT_REPLY I have access to the README.md file from the Zoekt codebase. This file provides an overview of Zoekt, which is a fast text search engine intended for use with source code. The README includes instructions for downloading, indexing, searching, and installing Zoekt. It also covers details about the search service, symbol search capabilities, and information about this particular fork of Zoekt maintained by Sourcegraph.
