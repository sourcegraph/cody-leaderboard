# CHAT_QUESTION What code do you have access to?

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided README.md file, I have access to information about the Zoekt project, which is a fast text search engine intended for use with source code. However, I don't have direct access to the actual source code files of the Zoekt project. The README provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, usage examples, and other high-level information, but it doesn't contain specific code snippets or implementations.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The README mentions several components and commands of the Zoekt project, including:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. zoekt-index
# CHAT_REPLY 2. zoekt-git-index
# CHAT_REPLY 3. zoekt-repo-index
# CHAT_REPLY 4. zoekt-mirror-gitiles
# CHAT_REPLY 5. zoekt-webserver
# CHAT_REPLY 6. zoekt (CLI tool)
# CHAT_REPLY 7. zoekt-indexserver
# CHAT_REPLY 8. zoekt-sourcegraph-indexserver
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY But again, I don't have access to the actual code for these components, just their names and some usage instructions.
