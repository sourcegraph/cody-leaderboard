# CHAT_QUESTION What code do you have access to?

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided codebase context, I have access to the README.md file for the Zoekt project. This file contains information about Zoekt, which is described as a fast text search engine intended for use with source code. The README includes instructions for downloading, indexing, searching, installation, and running Zoekt as a search service. It also mentions some details about symbol search and acknowledgements. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The README file is from a Sourcegraph fork of the original Google Zoekt project, and it includes some information about the differences between this fork and the original project. However, I don't have access to any actual source code files, just this README documentation.
