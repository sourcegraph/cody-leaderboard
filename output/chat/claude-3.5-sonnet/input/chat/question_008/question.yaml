# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. The code handles the truncation of content, ranges, and symbol information in chunk matches to stay within the specified limits.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. It provides separate limiting functions for chunk matches and line matches, allowing for flexible result limiting based on the search configuration.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Overall, this code is crucial for managing and presenting search results efficiently, ensuring that the output is not overwhelming and stays within the defined constraints of the search system.
