# CHAT_QUESTION What does this repo do??

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided code snippet, this repository appears to be part of a search engine or code search tool, likely named "zoekt". Here's what we can infer about its functionality:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. It provides functionality for sorting and truncating search results, specifically for file matches.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. It implements display limits for search results, controlling the number of documents (files) and matches shown.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. The code includes mechanisms for truncating results based on:
# CHAT_REPLY    - Maximum number of documents to display
# CHAT_REPLY    - Maximum number of matches to display
# CHAT_REPLY    - Whether to chunk matches or display them line by line
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. It has the ability to handle both chunk-based matches (ChunkMatches) and line-based matches (LineMatches).
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. For chunk-based matches, it can truncate not only the number of matches but also the content within each chunk, adjusting ranges and symbol information accordingly.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 6. The code is written in Go and seems to be part of a larger system for efficient code searching and result presentation.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY While we can't see the entire codebase, this file suggests that the repository is likely a part of a code search engine, focusing on efficiently processing and displaying search results with customizable limits and display options. The name "zoekt" (which means "search" in Dutch) further supports this inference.
