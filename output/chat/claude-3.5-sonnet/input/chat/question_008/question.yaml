# CHAT_QUESTION What does this repo do??

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the code provided, this repository appears to be part of a search engine or code search tool, likely named "zoekt". Here's a high-level overview of what this particular file does:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. It provides functionality for sorting and truncating search results, specifically file matches.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. The main components are:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY    - `SortAndTruncateFiles`: A convenience function that sorts and truncates file matches based on search options.
# CHAT_REPLY    - `DisplayTruncator`: A type that represents a function for truncating search results while respecting document and match display limits.
# CHAT_REPLY    - `NewDisplayTruncator`: A factory function that creates a `DisplayTruncator` based on given search options.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. The code implements logic to limit the number of documents (files) and matches displayed in search results, which is useful for managing large result sets and improving performance.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. It handles both chunk-based matches (likely for multi-line matches) and line-based matches, providing separate truncation logic for each.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. The truncation process is stateful, allowing for progressive loading of results while maintaining the specified limits.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY This code is likely part of a larger system that indexes and searches codebases, providing efficient and customizable search capabilities. The truncation and sorting features help in presenting search results in a more manageable and user-friendly manner, especially when dealing with large codebases or numerous search matches.
