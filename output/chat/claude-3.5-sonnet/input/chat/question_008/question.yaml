# CHAT_QUESTION What does this repo do??

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided code snippet, this repository appears to be part of a search-related project, likely named "zoekt". The code specifically deals with sorting, truncating, and limiting search results. Here are the main functionalities I can infer:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. Sorting and truncating file matches based on search options.
# CHAT_REPLY 2. Implementing display truncation to limit the number of documents and matches shown in search results.
# CHAT_REPLY 3. Limiting the number of matches (both chunk matches and line matches) in file search results.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The code provides functions and types to:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY - Sort and truncate file matches (`SortAndTruncateFiles`)
# CHAT_REPLY - Create a display truncator based on search options (`NewDisplayTruncator`)
# CHAT_REPLY - Limit the number of matches in search results (`limitMatches`, `limitChunkMatches`, `limitLineMatches`)
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY These functions seem to be part of a larger search system, possibly for code search or text search, where the results need to be organized, limited, and displayed efficiently. The code handles both chunk-based matches (possibly for multi-line results) and line-based matches.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY However, without more context from other parts of the codebase, it's difficult to determine the full scope and purpose of the entire repository. This specific file focuses on result limiting and display logic for search results.
