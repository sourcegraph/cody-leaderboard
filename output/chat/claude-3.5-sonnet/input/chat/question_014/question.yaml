# CHAT_QUESTION Are you capable of upgrading my pytorch version to 1.0.0, there is a guide in the pytorch site

# CHAT_REPLY I apologize, but I don't have any information about PyTorch or upgrading it in the codebase context provided. The context is about a text search engine called Zoekt, which is unrelated to PyTorch. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY However, I can provide some general advice:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. PyTorch typically provides upgrade guides on their official website for major version changes.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. Before upgrading, it's a good practice to check your current PyTorch version and review the changes and potential breaking changes in version 1.0.0.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. It's recommended to create a backup or use a version control system before making significant changes to your environment.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. You may need to update other dependencies alongside PyTorch.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. After upgrading, thoroughly test your existing code to ensure compatibility.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you need specific guidance on upgrading PyTorch, I'd recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation or upgrade guide for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
