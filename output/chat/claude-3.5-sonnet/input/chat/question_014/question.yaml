# CHAT_QUESTION Are you capable of upgrading my pytorch version to 1.0.0, there is a guide in the pytorch site

# CHAT_REPLY I apologize, but I don't have access to information about upgrading PyTorch versions or guides on the PyTorch site. The codebase context provided is for a project called Zoekt, which is a fast text search engine for source code. It doesn't contain any information related to PyTorch or version upgrades. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Is there anything I can help you with regarding the Zoekt codebase or its functionality? I'd be happy to assist with questions about text searching, indexing, or the specific features implemented in the code snippets provided.
