# CHAT_QUESTION Are you capable of upgrading my pytorch version to 1.0.0, there is a guide in the pytorch site

# CHAT_REPLY I apologize, but I don't have any information about upgrading PyTorch versions or guides on the PyTorch site in the provided codebase context. The context you've shared is about a project called Zoekt, which is a fast text search engine for source code. It doesn't contain any information related to PyTorch or its version upgrades.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The codebase context includes:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. A README file explaining what Zoekt is and how to use it.
# CHAT_REPLY 2. A Go source file (limit.go) containing functions for sorting and truncating search results.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Neither of these files contains information about PyTorch or its version upgrades. If you need help with upgrading PyTorch, I would recommend checking the official PyTorch documentation or asking a question specifically about PyTorch upgrades.

 files:
   - ../mocked/codebase_context/README.md
   - ../mocked/codebase_context/limit.go
