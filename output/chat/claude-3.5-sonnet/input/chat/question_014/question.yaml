# CHAT_QUESTION Are you capable of upgrading my pytorch version to 1.0.0, there is a guide in the pytorch site

# CHAT_REPLY I apologize, but I don't have any information about PyTorch or upgrading it in the codebase context you've provided. The context contains code related to Zoekt, which is a text search engine for source code. It doesn't include any PyTorch-related code or upgrade instructions.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY However, I can suggest that you visit the official PyTorch website for the most up-to-date and accurate information on upgrading PyTorch to version 1.0.0. The PyTorch documentation typically provides detailed guides for installation and upgrades.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you'd like assistance with a specific part of the Zoekt codebase or have questions about the search functionality it provides, I'd be happy to help with that based on the context provided.
