# CHAT_QUESTION Are you capable of upgrading my pytorch version to 1.0.0, there is a guide in the pytorch site

# CHAT_REPLY I apologize, but I don't have any information about upgrading PyTorch versions in the provided codebase context. The code you've shared is related to the Zoekt search engine, which is written in Go and doesn't contain any Python or PyTorch-related code.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The codebase context you've provided includes:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. A README file for the Zoekt project, which is a fast text search engine for source code.
# CHAT_REPLY 2. A Go file (limit.go) that contains functions for sorting and truncating search results.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Neither of these files contains information about PyTorch or its version upgrades. If you need help upgrading PyTorch, I'd recommend referring to the official PyTorch documentation or upgrade guides on the PyTorch website. They would have the most up-to-date and accurate information for upgrading PyTorch to version 1.0.0 or any other version.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you have a specific question about the Zoekt codebase or its functionality, I'd be happy to help with that based on the provided context.
