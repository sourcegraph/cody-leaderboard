 question: \@zoekt describe my code.

# CHAT_QUESTION \@zoekt describe my code.

# CHAT_REPLY I apologize, but I don't have enough information to describe your code based on the context provided. The codebase snippets you've shared don't contain any code specifically related to a "@zoekt describe my code" functionality.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The context includes:
# CHAT_REPLY 1. TypeScript interfaces for code intelligence and animal-related structures
# CHAT_REPLY 2. A partial Go package for an agent
# CHAT_REPLY 3. A more extensive Go file related to rate limiting and concurrency control
# CHAT_REPLY 4. A README for a Cody Agent package
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY None of these directly relate to a "@zoekt describe my code" feature. If you have a specific piece of code you'd like described, or if you're looking for information about a particular part of the codebase, please provide more details or the relevant code snippet. I'd be happy to help with more specific information.
