# CHAT_QUESTION \@zoekt describe my code.

# CHAT_REPLY I apologize, but I don't have enough context to describe your specific code. The codebase snippets provided don't contain any code that you've written or that I can attribute to you personally. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The context provided includes:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. TypeScript interfaces for `CodeIntelligence` and `Squirrel` related to code intelligence.
# CHAT_REPLY 2. A TypeScript interface for `Animal`.
# CHAT_REPLY 3. A partial Go package declaration for an `Agent`.
# CHAT_REPLY 4. A substantial Go file `limit.go` that deals with rate limiting and concurrency control for a service, likely related to Cody Gateway.
# CHAT_REPLY 5. A README for a Cody Agent package that implements a JSON-RPC server for non-ECMAScript clients.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you have a specific piece of code you'd like me to describe, please provide it, and I'd be happy to analyze it for you. Otherwise, I can't describe "your" code without more information.
