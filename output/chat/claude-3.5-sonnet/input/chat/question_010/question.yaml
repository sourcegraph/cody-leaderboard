 question: \@zoekt describe my code.
# CHAT
# CHAT_REPLY I apologize, but I don't have enough context to describe your code accurately. The provided codebase snippets are very limited and don't contain enough information to give a comprehensive description.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY From the given context, I can only say:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. There's a struct named `server` that embeds `grpc_testing.UnimplementedTestServiceServer`. This suggests it's part of a gRPC server implementation, likely for testing purposes.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. There's a README file that describes a package called `@sourcegraph/cody-agent`, which implements a JSON-RPC server for interacting with Cody via stdout/stdin. This package is meant for non-ECMAScript clients like JetBrains and NeoVim plugins.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY However, these two pieces of information don't seem directly related, and there's not enough code or context to provide a meaningful description of your specific codebase.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you want a more detailed description of your code, you would need to provide more context, such as additional code snippets, file structures, or specific questions about particular parts of your codebase.
