# CHAT_QUESTION \@zoekt describe my code.

# CHAT_REPLY I don't have enough information to describe your specific code. The codebase context provided doesn't include any code related to a user's personal project or a @zoekt command. The context mainly includes TypeScript interfaces, Go package definitions, and information about a Cody Agent. If you have a specific piece of code you'd like described, please provide it and I'll be happy to help.
