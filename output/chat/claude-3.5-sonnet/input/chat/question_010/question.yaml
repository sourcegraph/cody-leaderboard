 question: \@zoekt describe my code.
# CHAT
# CHAT_REPLY I apologize, but I don't have enough context to describe your code based on the limited information provided. The codebase snippets you've shared don't contain any code related to Zoekt or a description of your specific code.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The context you've provided includes:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. A small Go struct definition for a server that implements an unimplemented gRPC test service.
# CHAT_REPLY 2. A README for a Cody Agent package, which implements a JSON-RPC server for non-ECMAScript clients to interact with Cody.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Neither of these snippets relates to Zoekt or provides enough information to describe your specific code. If you have a particular piece of code you'd like described, or if you have questions about the Cody Agent or the gRPC server snippet, please provide more details or context, and I'll be happy to help.
