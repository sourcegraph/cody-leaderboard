# CHAT_QUESTION describe my code

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided codebase context, it appears you have a codebase for a search engine called Zoekt. Here's a description of the code:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. The codebase is written primarily in Go, with some TypeScript components.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. Zoekt is described as a fast text search engine intended for use with source code.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. Key components of the codebase include:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY    - Indexing functionality for directories, Git repositories, and other repository types.
# CHAT_REPLY    - Search functionality with various options and optimizations.
# CHAT_REPLY    - A web interface and JSON API for searching.
# CHAT_REPLY    - Command-line tools for indexing and searching.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. The code includes sophisticated search algorithms, including:
# CHAT_REPLY    - Match tree construction and evaluation
# CHAT_REPLY    - Regular expression matching
# CHAT_REPLY    - Substring matching
# CHAT_REPLY    - File name and content matching
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. There's functionality for sorting and truncating search results based on various criteria.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 6. The codebase handles multiple repositories, branches, and has features like language detection.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 7. It includes performance optimizations like pruning match trees and using various cost heuristics.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 8. There's support for symbol search, likely using ctags.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 9. The code handles various search options, including context lines, match limits, and repository-specific limits.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 10. There's functionality for simplifying and optimizing queries before execution.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 11. The codebase appears to be a fork of an original Google project, now maintained by Sourcegraph.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY This codebase represents a complex and feature-rich search engine specifically tailored for searching source code across multiple repositories and branches.
