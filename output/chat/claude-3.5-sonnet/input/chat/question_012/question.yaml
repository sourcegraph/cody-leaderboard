 question: Is my codebase clean?

# CHAT_QUESTION Is my codebase clean?

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided codebase context, it's difficult to make a comprehensive assessment of whether your codebase is "clean" or not. The context provided is limited and doesn't give a full picture of the entire codebase. However, I can make a few observations:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. The code snippets provided seem to be well-structured and organized. For example, the Go code in `limit.go` appears to have clear function definitions and comments explaining their purpose.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. The README.md file is comprehensive and well-organized, providing clear instructions for installation, indexing, and searching.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. The TypeScript interfaces in `squirrel.ts` and `animal.ts` are simple and clearly defined.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. The Go file `agent.go` seems to be incomplete or a placeholder, containing only a package declaration and a comment.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. The codebase appears to be a fork of an existing project (Zoekt), which is acknowledged in the README.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To determine if a codebase is truly "clean," you would typically look for:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY - Consistent coding style and formatting
# CHAT_REPLY - Proper documentation and comments
# CHAT_REPLY - Clear and meaningful variable/function names
# CHAT_REPLY - Absence of code duplication
# CHAT_REPLY - Proper error handling
# CHAT_REPLY - Good organization of files and directories
# CHAT_REPLY - Adherence to language-specific best practices
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY While the provided snippets show some of these characteristics, a full assessment would require access to the entire codebase and a more in-depth code review.
