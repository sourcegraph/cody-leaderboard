# CHAT_QUESTION Is my codebase clean?

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the codebase context provided, your codebase appears to be well-structured and organized. Here's a high-level overview and some guidance:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. The codebase seems to be primarily written in Go, with some TypeScript interfaces defined as well.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. The main functionality appears to be centered around a text search engine called Zoekt, which is designed for searching source code efficiently.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. The code structure includes separate files for different components, such as limits, agents, and animals, which suggests good separation of concerns.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. There's a comprehensive README.md file that provides installation instructions, usage guidelines, and explanations of various features, which is a positive sign of good documentation practices.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. The code includes comments and documentation strings, which helps in understanding the purpose and functionality of different components.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 6. The presence of interfaces like `CodeIntelligence` and `Squirrel` suggests that the codebase is designed with extensibility in mind.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To further improve the cleanliness of your codebase, you could consider:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. Ensuring consistent code formatting across all files.
# CHAT_REPLY 2. Adding more inline comments to explain complex logic, especially in the `limit.go` file.
# CHAT_REPLY 3. Implementing comprehensive unit tests if not already present.
# CHAT_REPLY 4. Regularly reviewing and refactoring code to maintain cleanliness as the project evolves.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Overall, your codebase appears to be well-maintained and structured, with good documentation practices in place.
