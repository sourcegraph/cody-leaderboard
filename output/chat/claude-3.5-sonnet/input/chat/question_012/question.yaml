# CHAT_QUESTION Is my codebase clean?

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided codebase context, I don't have enough information to determine if your codebase is "clean" or not. The context provided includes:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. Some TypeScript interface definitions
# CHAT_REPLY 2. A partial Go package definition
# CHAT_REPLY 3. A Go file with some search-related functions
# CHAT_REPLY 4. A README file for a project called Zoekt
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY These snippets don't provide a comprehensive view of the entire codebase, its structure, coding standards, or overall quality. To determine if a codebase is "clean," one would typically need to review:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. Code organization and structure
# CHAT_REPLY 2. Consistency in coding style
# CHAT_REPLY 3. Proper documentation and comments
# CHAT_REPLY 4. Absence of code smells or anti-patterns
# CHAT_REPLY 5. Test coverage
# CHAT_REPLY 6. Adherence to best practices for the languages used
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Without access to the full codebase and more context, it's not possible to make a definitive statement about whether the codebase is clean or not.
