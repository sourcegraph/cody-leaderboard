    getInfo(): string {

This Dog class implements the Animal interface by including the required `name` and `age` properties. Additionally, it includes:

1. A `breed` property specific to dogs.
2. A constructor to initialize the dog's properties.
3. A `bark()` method that logs a barking sound to the console.
4. A `getInfo()` method that returns a string with information about the dog.

You can use this class as follows:

```typescript
const myDog = new Dog(""Buddy"", 3, ""Labrador"");
console.log(myDog.getInfo()); // Output: Buddy is a 3 year old Labrador.
myDog.bark(); // Output: Buddy says: Woof!

1. In the `limit.go` file, we can see an example of using a slice:

```go
AllowedModels []string `json:""allowedModels""`
```

This declares a slice of strings named `AllowedModels`.

2. The `EvaluateAllowedModels` function in `limit.go` uses the `slices.Contains` function:

```go
if slices.Contains(prefixedMasterAllowlist, val) {
    result = append(result, val)
}
```

This suggests that Go has a `slices` package with utility functions for working with slices.

3. The `append` function is used to add elements to a slice:

```go
result = append(result, val)
```

In Go, slices are dynamic, flexible views into arrays. They have three components: a pointer to the array, the length of the segment, and its capacity. Slices provide a convenient and efficient way to work with sequences of typed data.

Some key points about slices in Go:

- They can grow and shrink as needed.
- The `make` function can be used to create slices with a specific length and capacity.
- Slices can be created from arrays or other slices.
- The `append` function is commonly used to add elements to a slice.
- Slices support operations like slicing (e.g., `slice[1:4]`) to create new slices from existing ones.

They are lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime, rather than operating system threads. Here's an overview of how goroutines work:

1. Lightweight:
   Goroutines are much lighter than traditional threads. They typically use only 2KB of stack space initially and can grow as needed. This allows you to create thousands or even millions of goroutines without exhausting system resources.

2. Multiplexing:
   The Go runtime multiplexes goroutines onto a smaller number of operating system threads. This is done using an M:N scheduling model, where M goroutines are scheduled across N OS threads.

3. Creation:
   You can start a goroutine by using the `go` keyword followed by a function call:

   ```go
   go someFunction()
   ```

4. Scheduling:
   The Go runtime includes a scheduler that manages goroutine execution. It can start, stop, and resume goroutines as needed, distributing them across available CPU cores.

5. Communication:
   Goroutines communicate through channels, which provide a way to send and receive values between goroutines. This encourages the use of message passing for synchronization rather than shared memory and locks.

   ```go
   ch := make(chan int)
   go func() { ch <- 42 }()
   value := <-ch
   ```

6. Concurrency vs Parallelism:
   Goroutines enable concurrency, which is the composition of independently executing processes. Parallelism (simultaneous execution) may occur if the system has multiple CPU cores and the Go runtime schedules goroutines to run in parallel.

7. Non-preemptive:
   Goroutine scheduling is cooperative, meaning goroutines yield control when they are idle or logically blocked. The scheduler can also preempt a goroutine if it runs for too long.

8. Stack Management:
   Goroutines use segmented stacks that can grow and shrink as needed. This allows for efficient memory usage.

9. Synchronization:
   While channels are the preferred method for synchronization, Go also provides traditional synchronization primitives like mutexes and wait groups in the `sync` package.

10. Graceful Termination:
    Goroutines don't have an explicit termination or killing mechanism. They exit when their function completes or when the program exits.

Here's a simple example demonstrating goroutines and channels:

```go
package main

import (
    ""fmt""

This example demonstrates how goroutines can be used to create a simple worker pool, processing jobs concurrently and communicating results through channels.",how do goroutines work?,,,2,,,,,,,,

Here's a summary of its main components and functions:

1. `SortAndTruncateFiles`: This function sorts and truncates a list of FileMatch results based on the provided SearchOptions.

2. `DisplayTruncator`: This is a type definition for a function that enforces document and match display limits by truncating and mutating search results.

3. `NewDisplayTruncator`: This function creates a new DisplayTruncator based on the provided SearchOptions. It enforces limits on the number of documents and matches displayed.

4. `limitMatches`: This function limits the number of matches in the search results based on the provided limit and whether to chunk matches or not.

5. `limitChunkMatches`: This function limits the number of ChunkMatches in a FileMatch, truncating the results to fit within the specified limit.

6. `limitLineMatches`: This function limits the number of LineMatches in a FileMatch, truncating the results to fit within the specified limit.

The file primarily deals with managing the display of search results, ensuring that the number of documents and matches shown to the user stays within the specified limits. This is useful for controlling the amount of data presented to the user and potentially improving performance by limiting the size of the result set.",what does @limit.go do?,,,2,,,,,,,,
