```typescript
class Dog implements Animal {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    breed: string;

    constructor(name: string, age: number, breed: string) {
        this.name = name;

    }

    fetch(item: string): void {
        console.log(`${this.name} is fetching the ${item}.`);
    }
}
```

This Dog class implements the Animal interface, including the required `name` and `age` properties. I've also added a `breed` property specific to dogs. The class includes a constructor to initialize these properties, as well as two methods: `bark()` and `fetch()`, which are common dog behaviors.

You can use this class like this:

```typescript
const myDog = new Dog(""Buddy"", 3, ""Labrador"");
console.log(myDog.name); // Output: Buddy
console.log(myDog.age);  // Output: 3
console.log(myDog.breed); // Output: Labrador
myDog.bark(); // Output: Buddy says: Woof woof!
myDog.fetch(""ball""); // Output: Buddy is fetching the ball.
```

1. Dynamic length: Unlike arrays, slices can grow or shrink in size.

3. Three components: A slice consists of a pointer to the array, the length of the slice, and its capacity.

4. Creation: You can create slices using the make() function, slice literals, or by slicing an existing array or slice.

5. Appending: The append() function is used to add elements to a slice, automatically handling capacity increases when needed.

6. Slicing: You can create new slices from existing ones using the slicing syntax (e.g., slice[start:end]).

7. Variadic functions: Slices are often used with variadic functions to pass multiple arguments.

8. Efficiency: Slices provide efficient random access and iteration over elements.

Zoekt is a fast text search engine designed specifically for searching source code. It's a fork of the original Google project, now maintained by Sourcegraph as the main source of Zoekt.

Key points from the README:

1. Installation: You can download Zoekt using Go's package manager.

2. Indexing: Zoekt provides tools for indexing directories, Git repositories, and Repo repositories.

3. Searching: You can search using a web interface, JSON API, or CLI.

4. Search Service: Zoekt includes a service management program called zoekt-indexserver for mirroring and indexing repositories.

5. Symbol Search: It recommends installing Universal ctags for improved ranking.

6. Features: The Sourcegraph fork includes additional features like the zoekt-sourcegraph-indexserver, exposed API via keegancsmith/rpc, and support for symbol/ctag data in results.

7. Usage: The README provides examples and instructions for various use cases, including indexing, searching, and setting up as a service.

8. Origin: The project name ""Zoekt"" is Dutch, roughly pronounced as ""zooked"" in English, and means ""seek"" - tied to the quote ""seek, and ye shall eat spinach"".

They are lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime, rather than operating system threads. Here's an overview of how goroutines work:

1. Lightweight:
   Goroutines are much lighter than traditional threads. They typically use only 2KB of stack space initially and can grow as needed. This allows you to create thousands or even millions of goroutines without significant performance overhead.

2. Multiplexing:
   The Go runtime multiplexes goroutines onto a smaller number of OS threads. This is managed by the Go scheduler, which is part of the runtime.

3. Creation:
   You can start a goroutine by using the `go` keyword followed by a function call:

   ```go
   go someFunction()
   ```

4. Concurrency vs Parallelism:
   Goroutines enable concurrency, which doesn't necessarily mean parallelism. Concurrency is about dealing with multiple things at once, while parallelism is about doing multiple things at once.

5. Communication:
   Goroutines communicate with each other using channels. This follows Go's philosophy of ""Do not communicate by sharing memory; instead, share memory by communicating.""

   ```go
   ch := make(chan int)
   go func() { ch <- 42 }()
   value := <-ch
   ```

6. Scheduling:
   The Go scheduler uses a technique called ""m:n scheduling"", where m goroutines are multiplexed on n OS threads. The scheduler is responsible for distributing runnable goroutines over multiple threads.

7. Context Switching:
   Context switching between goroutines is much cheaper than OS thread context switching, as it's managed entirely by the Go runtime in user space.

8. Blocking:
   When a goroutine blocks (e.g., on I/O or channel operations), the Go runtime automatically moves other goroutines to another OS thread if available.

9. Work Stealing:
   The Go scheduler implements work stealing, where idle processors can ""steal"" tasks from busy processors' queues, improving overall system utilization.

10. Garbage Collection:
    Goroutines that are no longer needed are automatically garbage collected, so you don't need to manage their lifecycle explicitly.

Here's a simple example demonstrating goroutines:

```go
package main

import (
    ""fmt""
    ""time""
)

func say(s string) {
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
        fmt.Println(s)
    }
}

func main() {
    go say(""world"")
    say(""hello"")
}
```

In this example, two goroutines run concurrently: one printing ""world"" and another printing ""hello"".
