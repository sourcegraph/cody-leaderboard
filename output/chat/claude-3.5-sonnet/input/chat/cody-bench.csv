```typescript
class Dog implements Animal {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    breed: string;

    constructor(name: string, age: number, breed: string) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.breed = breed;
    }

    bark(): void {
        console.log(`${this.name} says: Woof!`);
    }
}
```

This Dog class:

1. Implements the Animal interface, which requires `name` and `age` properties.
2. Adds an additional `breed` property specific to dogs.
3. Includes a constructor to initialize these properties.
4. Adds a `bark` method as a dog-specific behavior.

You can use this class like this:

```typescript
const myDog = new Dog(""Buddy"", 3, ""Labrador"");
console.log(myDog.name); // Output: Buddy
console.log(myDog.age);  // Output: 3
console.log(myDog.breed); // Output: Labrador
myDog.bark(); // Output: Buddy says: Woof!
```

This implementation ensures that the Dog class satisfies the Animal interface while also including dog-specific properties and methods.",,,,,,,,,,,

1. The interface is named `Squirrel`.

2. It is described in a comment as ""Squirrel is a code intelligence API.""

3. The `Squirrel` interface declares one method:
   - `symbolInformation(file: string): CodeIntelligence`
     This method takes a `file` parameter of type string and returns a `CodeIntelligence` object.

4. The `CodeIntelligence` interface is also defined, which contains a `symbols` property that is an array of strings.

So, Squirrel appears to be an API interface for retrieving code intelligence information, specifically symbol information from files. However, the implementation details of this API are not provided in the given context.",,,,,,,,,,,
