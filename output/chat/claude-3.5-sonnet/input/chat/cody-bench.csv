```typescript
class Dog implements Animal {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    breed: string;

    constructor(name: string, age: number, breed: string) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.breed = breed;
    }

    bark(): void {
        console.log(`${this.name} says: Woof!`);
    }
}
```

This implementation does the following:

1. The `Dog` class implements the `Animal` interface, which requires `name` and `age` properties.
2. We've added an additional `breed` property specific to dogs.
3. The constructor initializes all three properties.
4. We've also added a `bark()` method as a dog-specific behavior.

You can use this class like this:

```typescript
const myDog = new Dog(""Buddy"", 3, ""Labrador"");
console.log(myDog.name); // Output: Buddy
console.log(myDog.age);  // Output: 3
console.log(myDog.breed); // Output: Labrador
myDog.bark(); // Output: Buddy says: Woof!
```

They are lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime, rather than operating system threads. Here's an overview of how goroutines work:

1. Lightweight:
   Goroutines are much lighter than traditional threads. They typically use only 2KB of stack space initially and can grow as needed. This allows you to create thousands or even millions of goroutines without exhausting system resources.

2. Multiplexing:
   The Go runtime multiplexes goroutines onto a smaller number of operating system threads. This is done using an M:N scheduling model, where M goroutines are scheduled across N OS threads.

3. Creation:
   You can start a goroutine by using the `go` keyword followed by a function call:

   ```go
   go someFunction()
   ```

4. Scheduling:
   The Go runtime includes a scheduler that manages goroutine execution. It can start, stop, and resume goroutines as needed, distributing them across available CPU cores.

5. Communication:
   Goroutines communicate through channels, which provide a way to send and receive values between goroutines. This encourages the use of message passing for synchronization rather than shared memory and locks.

   ```go
   ch := make(chan int)
   go func() { ch <- 42 }()
   value := <-ch
   ```

6. Concurrency vs Parallelism:
   Goroutines enable concurrency, which is the composition of independently executing processes. Parallelism (simultaneous execution) may occur if the system has multiple CPU cores and the Go runtime schedules goroutines to run in parallel.

7. Non-preemptive:
   Goroutine scheduling is cooperative, meaning goroutines yield control when they are idle or logically blocked. The scheduler can also preempt a goroutine if it runs for too long.

8. Stack Management:
   Goroutines use segmented stacks that can grow and shrink as needed. This allows for efficient memory usage.

9. Synchronization:
   While channels are the preferred method for synchronization, Go also provides traditional synchronization primitives like mutexes and wait groups in the `sync` package.

10. Graceful Termination:
    Goroutines don't have an explicit termination or killing mechanism. They exit when their function completes or when the program exits.

Here's a simple example demonstrating goroutines and channels:

```go
package main

import (
    ""fmt""
    ""time""
)

func worker(id int, jobs <-chan int, results chan<- int) {
    for j := range jobs {
        fmt.Printf(""Worker %d started job %d\n"", id, j)
        time.Sleep(time.Second)
        fmt.Printf(""Worker %d finished job %d\n"", id, j)
        results <- j * 2
    }
}

func main() {
    jobs := make(chan int, 100)
    results := make(chan int, 100)

    // Start 3 worker goroutines
    for w := 1; w <= 3; w++ {
        go worker(w, jobs, results)
    }

    // Send 5 jobs
    for j := 1; j <= 5; j++ {
        jobs <- j
    }
    close(jobs)

    // Collect results
    for a := 1; a <= 5; a++ {
        <-results
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates how goroutines can be used to create a simple worker pool, processing jobs concurrently and communicating results through channels.",how do goroutines work?,,,,,,,,,,,

   - Document limit: restricts the total number of file matches returned.
   - Match limit: restricts the total number of matches across all files.

6. It provides functionality to truncate the content of matches when necessary, ensuring that the limits are respected while maintaining the integrity of the search results.
