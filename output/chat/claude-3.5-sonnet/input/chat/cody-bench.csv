    breed: string;

They are built on top of arrays but offer more functionality and dynamic sizing. Here are some key points about slices in Go:

1. Dynamic length: Unlike arrays, slices can grow or shrink in size.

2. Reference type: Slices are reference types, meaning they refer to an underlying array.

3. Three components: A slice consists of a pointer to the array, the length of the slice, and its capacity.

4. Creation: You can create slices using the make() function, slice literals, or by slicing an existing array or slice.

5. Appending: The append() function allows you to add elements to a slice, automatically handling capacity increases when needed.

6. Slicing: You can create new slices from existing ones using the slicing syntax (e.g., slice[start:end]).

7. Variadic functions: Slices are often used with variadic functions to pass a variable number of arguments.

In the provided code, we can see an example of slice usage in the EvaluateAllowedModels function, where slices.Contains is used to check if an element exists in a slice.

They are lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime, rather than operating system threads. Here's an overview of how goroutines work:

1. Lightweight:
   Goroutines are much lighter than traditional threads. They typically use only 2KB of stack space initially and can grow as needed. This allows you to create thousands or even millions of goroutines without exhausting system resources.

2. Multiplexing:
   The Go runtime multiplexes goroutines onto a smaller number of operating system threads. This is done using an M:N scheduling model, where M goroutines are scheduled across N OS threads.

3. Creation:
   You can start a goroutine by using the `go` keyword followed by a function call:

   ```go
   go someFunction()
   ```

4. Scheduling:
   The Go runtime includes a scheduler that manages goroutine execution. It can start, stop, and resume goroutines as needed, distributing them across available CPU cores.

5. Communication:
   Goroutines communicate through channels, which provide a way to send and receive values between goroutines. This encourages the use of message passing for synchronization rather than shared memory and locks.

   ```go
   ch := make(chan int)
   go func() { ch <- 42 }()
   value := <-ch
   ```

6. Concurrency vs Parallelism:
   Goroutines enable concurrency, which is the composition of independently executing processes. Parallelism (simultaneous execution) may occur if the system has multiple CPU cores and the Go runtime schedules goroutines to run in parallel.

7. Non-preemptive:
   Goroutine scheduling is cooperative, meaning goroutines yield control when they are idle or logically blocked. The scheduler can also preempt a goroutine if it runs for too long.

8. Stack Management:
   Goroutines use segmented stacks that can grow and shrink as needed. This allows for efficient memory usage.

9. Synchronization:
   While channels are the preferred method for synchronization, Go also provides traditional synchronization primitives like mutexes and wait groups in the `sync` package.

10. Graceful Termination:
    Goroutines don't have an explicit termination or killing mechanism. They exit when their function completes or when the program exits.

Here's a simple example demonstrating goroutines and channels:

```go
package main

import (
    ""fmt""
    ""time""
)

func worker(id int, jobs <-chan int, results chan<- int) {
    for j := range jobs {
        fmt.Printf(""Worker %d started job %d\n"", id, j)
        time.Sleep(time.Second)
        fmt.Printf(""Worker %d finished job %d\n"", id, j)
        results <- j * 2
    }
}

func main() {
    jobs := make(chan int, 100)
    results := make(chan int, 100)

    // Start 3 worker goroutines
    for w := 1; w <= 3; w++ {
        go worker(w, jobs, results)
    }

    // Send 5 jobs
    for j := 1; j <= 5; j++ {
        jobs <- j
    }
    close(jobs)

    // Collect results
    for a := 1; a <= 5; a++ {
        <-results
    }
}
```

1. SortAndTruncateFiles: A convenience function that sorts and truncates file matches based on search options.

2. DisplayTruncator: A type definition for a function that enforces document and match display limits.

3. NewDisplayTruncator: Creates a DisplayTruncator based on the provided search options, handling both document and match limits.

4. limitMatches: A function that applies limits to matches within files, supporting both chunk and line matches.

5. limitChunkMatches: Limits the number of chunk matches in a file, handling ranges, symbol info, and content.

6. limitLineMatches: Limits the number of line matches in a file.

These components work together to provide efficient and flexible result limiting for search operations, ensuring that the output adheres to specified constraints while maintaining relevant information.",what does @limit.go do?,explain code,,,1,,1,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
