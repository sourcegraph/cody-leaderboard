```typescript
class Dog implements Animal {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    breed: string;

    constructor(name: string, age: number, breed: string) {
        this.name = name;

        this.breed = breed;
    }

    bark(): void {
        console.log(`${this.name} says: Woof!`);
    }
}
```

This implementation does the following:

1. The `Dog` class implements the `Animal` interface, which requires `name` and `age` properties.
2. We've added an additional `breed` property specific to dogs.
3. The constructor initializes all three properties.
4. We've also added a `bark()` method as a dog-specific behavior.

You can use this class like this:

```typescript
const myDog = new Dog(""Buddy"", 3, ""Labrador"");
console.log(myDog.name); // Output: Buddy
console.log(myDog.age);  // Output: 3
console.log(myDog.breed); // Output: Labrador
myDog.bark(); // Output: Buddy says: Woof!
```

  width: 20px;
  height: 20px;

/* Create a checkmark using pseudo-element */
input[type=""checkbox""]:checked::before {
  content: '\2714'; /* Unicode character for a checkmark */
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;

}

/* Style the label next to the checkbox (optional) */
label {

```

This CSS will create a custom checkbox with a light purple theme. Here's what each part does:

1. We hide the default checkbox appearance.
2. We create a custom box with a light purple border.
3. When checked, the checkbox gets a light purple background.
4. We add a white checkmark when the box is checked.
5. On hover, the border color darkens slightly.
6. We also style the label next to the checkbox (if you have one).

To use this, you would have HTML like this:

```html
<input type=""checkbox"" id=""myCheckbox"">
<label for=""myCheckbox"">Check me</label>
```

You can adjust the colors, sizes, and other properties to fit your specific design needs. The colors used here are:

Its primary purpose is to detect and respond to various file system events that occur within the watched directory. Here are some key functions and uses of a directory watcher:

1. Detect changes: It can identify when files or subdirectories are created, modified, deleted, or renamed within the watched directory.

2. Real-time notifications: It provides real-time or near real-time notifications about the detected changes.

3. Trigger actions: Based on the detected changes, it can trigger specific actions or callbacks in an application.

4. Efficient monitoring: Directory watchers typically use efficient system-level APIs to monitor changes, reducing the need for constant polling of the file system.

5. Recursive watching: Many directory watchers can monitor not just the specified directory but also its subdirectories recursively.

Common use cases for directory watchers include:

1. Development tools: IDEs and text editors use directory watchers to detect file changes for features like auto-reload or live preview.

2. Build systems: To automatically trigger rebuilds when source files change.

3. Backup and synchronization tools: To detect changes that need to be backed up or synced.

4. File indexing: For search engines or file management systems to keep their indexes up-to-date.

5. Log monitoring: To watch log directories and process new entries in real-time.

6. Hot-reloading in web development: To automatically refresh browsers or restart servers when files change during development.

Directory watchers are available in many programming languages and operating systems, often through built-in APIs or third-party libraries. Examples include:

- Node.js: fs.watch() or third-party libraries like chokidar
- Python: watchdog library
- Java: WatchService API
- .NET: FileSystemWatcher class
- macOS/iOS: FSEvents API
- Linux: inotify API
