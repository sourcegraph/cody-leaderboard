# CHAT_QUESTION how to upgrade my python version?

# CHAT_REPLY I apologize, but the codebase context provided does not contain any information about upgrading Python versions. The given code snippets and README are related to a Cody Agent implementation in Go, and they don't include any Python-related information.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To upgrade your Python version, you would typically follow these general steps:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. Visit the official Python website (python.org)
# CHAT_REPLY 2. Download the latest version for your operating system
# CHAT_REPLY 3. Run the installer
# CHAT_REPLY 4. Update your system PATH if necessary
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY However, the exact process can vary depending on your operating system and current setup. If you need specific help with upgrading Python, I'd recommend consulting Python's official documentation or asking a question specifically about Python version upgrades.
