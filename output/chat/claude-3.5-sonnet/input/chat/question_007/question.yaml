 question: how to upgrade my python version?
# CHAT
# CHAT_REPLY I apologize, but I don't have any information about upgrading Python versions based on the provided codebase context. The code snippet you shared is written in Go and defines a struct called `server` that embeds an unimplemented gRPC test service. This code is not related to Python or version upgrades.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To get accurate information about upgrading your Python version, you would need to consult Python-specific documentation or resources. The provided Go code snippet does not contain any relevant information for that task.
