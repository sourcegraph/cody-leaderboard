# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided codebase context, Squirrel is a code intelligence API. It's defined as an interface in TypeScript that provides functionality for retrieving symbol information from files.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The Squirrel interface has a method called `symbolInformation` which takes a file path as a string parameter and returns a `CodeIntelligence` object. This object contains an array of symbols found in the specified file.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The purpose of Squirrel appears to be to offer code intelligence capabilities, which typically include features like symbol lookup, definition finding, and potentially other code analysis functionalities. This kind of API can be very useful in development tools, IDEs, or other applications that need to understand and analyze code structure.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The interface is designed to be simple and focused, with just one method, making it easy to implement and use in various contexts where code intelligence is needed.
