# CHAT_QUESTION what is squirrel?

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the codebase context provided, Squirrel is a code intelligence API. It's defined as an interface in TypeScript that has a method called `symbolInformation`. This method takes a file path as a string parameter and returns a `CodeIntelligence` object, which contains an array of symbols.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The purpose of Squirrel appears to be to provide symbol information for a given file, which is a common feature in code intelligence systems. These systems help developers navigate and understand large codebases by providing information about symbols (such as functions, classes, variables) defined in the code.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The `CodeIntelligence` interface suggests that the API returns symbol information, though in this simplified version it only includes an array of strings representing the symbols.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY This interface could be implemented to create a concrete Squirrel service that analyzes code files and extracts symbol information, which would be useful for features like code navigation, auto-completion, or documentation generation in development tools.
