# CHAT_QUESTION what is squirrel?

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided codebase context, Squirrel is a code intelligence API. It is defined as an interface in TypeScript that provides functionality for retrieving symbol information from files.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The Squirrel interface has a single method called `symbolInformation` which takes a file path as a string parameter and returns a `CodeIntelligence` object. This object contains an array of symbols found in the specified file.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The purpose of Squirrel appears to be to offer a way to extract and work with code symbols, which can be useful for various code analysis, navigation, and intelligence features in development tools or environments.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Here's a breakdown of the key components:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. The `CodeIntelligence` interface, which contains an array of strings representing symbols.
# CHAT_REPLY 2. The `Squirrel` interface, which defines the `symbolInformation` method.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY This API could be implemented to provide code intelligence features such as auto-completion, go-to-definition, or symbol search functionality in an IDE or code editor.
