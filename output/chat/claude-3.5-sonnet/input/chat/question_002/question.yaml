# CHAT_QUESTION what is squirrel?

# CHAT_REPLY Squirrel is a code intelligence API defined in the provided codebase context. It's an interface that offers functionality related to code analysis and symbol information retrieval.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Specifically, the Squirrel interface includes a method called `symbolInformation` that takes a file path as input and returns `CodeIntelligence` data. This `CodeIntelligence` contains an array of symbols found in the specified file.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The purpose of Squirrel appears to be providing a way to extract and work with symbol information from source code files, which is a common feature in code intelligence and analysis tools.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Here's the relevant interface definition from the codebase:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY ```typescript:mocked/enhanced_context/squirrel.ts
# CHAT_REPLY interface Squirrel {
# CHAT_REPLY     symbolInformation(file: string): CodeIntelligence
# CHAT_REPLY }
# CHAT_REPLY ```
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY This interface suggests that Squirrel is designed to be implemented by systems that can analyze code and provide symbol-level information, which could be useful for features like code navigation, auto-completion, or other IDE-like functionalities.
