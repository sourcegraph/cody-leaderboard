# CHAT_QUESTION what is squirrel?

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided codebase context, Squirrel is a code intelligence API. It's defined as an interface in TypeScript that includes a method called `symbolInformation`. This method takes a file path as input and returns `CodeIntelligence`, which contains an array of symbols.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The purpose of Squirrel appears to be to provide symbol information for a given file, which is a common feature in code intelligence systems. These systems are typically used to enhance developer productivity by offering features like code navigation, auto-completion, and symbol lookup.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The `Squirrel` interface suggests that it's designed to be implemented by concrete classes that would provide the actual functionality for retrieving symbol information from files.
