# CHAT_QUESTION what is squirrel?

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided codebase context, Squirrel is a code intelligence API. It's defined as an interface in TypeScript that includes a method called `symbolInformation`. This method takes a file path as input and returns `CodeIntelligence`, which contains an array of symbols.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The Squirrel interface is designed to provide symbol information for a given file, which is a key feature in code intelligence systems. Such systems are typically used to enhance developer productivity by offering features like auto-completion, go-to-definition, and symbol search across a codebase.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The `CodeIntelligence` interface, which is the return type of the `symbolInformation` method, currently only contains a `symbols` array of strings. This suggests that Squirrel, at its core, is focused on identifying and returning symbol information from source code files.
