# CHAT_QUESTION what is squirrel?

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided codebase context, Squirrel is a code intelligence API. It's defined as an interface that includes a method called `symbolInformation`. This method takes a file path as input and returns `CodeIntelligence`, which contains an array of symbols.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The purpose of Squirrel appears to be to provide symbol information for a given file, which is a common feature in code intelligence systems. This can be useful for various IDE-like functionalities such as code navigation, auto-completion, or symbol lookup across a codebase.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The `CodeIntelligence` interface suggests that the API currently focuses on symbol information, but it could potentially be expanded to include other code intelligence features in the future.
