# CHAT_QUESTION how do goroutines work?

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided code, there is no specific implementation or explanation of how goroutines work in general. The code does use a goroutine in one place, but it doesn't explain the general workings of goroutines.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The only usage of a goroutine in this code is in the `TryAcquire` method of the `updateOnErrorLimiter` struct:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY ```go
# CHAT_REPLY go func() {
# CHAT_REPLY     if updateErr := u.actor.Update(context.WithoutCancel(ctx)); updateErr != nil &&
# CHAT_REPLY         !IsErrActorRecentlyUpdated(updateErr) {
# CHAT_REPLY         u.logger.Warn("unexpected error updating actor",
# CHAT_REPLY             log.Error(updateErr),
# CHAT_REPLY             log.NamedError("originalError", err))
# CHAT_REPLY     }
# CHAT_REPLY }()
# CHAT_REPLY ```
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY This goroutine is used to perform an asynchronous update of the actor when certain errors occur. It's launched with the `go` keyword, which starts a new goroutine, but the code doesn't provide any general explanation of how goroutines work in Go.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To answer the question "how do goroutines work?" would require information beyond what's provided in this specific code snippet. The code simply uses a goroutine but doesn't explain the mechanics or inner workings of goroutines in Go.
