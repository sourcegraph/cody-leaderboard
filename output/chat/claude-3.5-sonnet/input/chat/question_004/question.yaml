 question: how do slices work in go?
# CHAT
# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided codebase context, I don't have specific information about how slices work in Go. The code snippets don't include a detailed explanation or implementation of Go slices.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY However, I can point out that the `limit.go` file does use the `slices` package in one instance:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY ```go
# CHAT_REPLY if slices.Contains(prefixedMasterAllowlist, val) {
# CHAT_REPLY     result = append(result, val)
# CHAT_REPLY }
# CHAT_REPLY ```
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY This suggests that Go has a `slices` package with a `Contains` function, which is used to check if a slice contains a specific value. The `append` function is also used here to add elements to a slice.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Beyond this, I don't have enough information from the given context to provide a comprehensive explanation of how slices work in Go. If you need more details about Go slices, you would need to refer to Go's official documentation or other Go-specific resources.
