 question: how do slices work in go?

# CHAT_QUESTION how do slices work in go?

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided codebase context, there isn't specific information about how slices work in Go. The code snippets don't include detailed explanations or examples of slice usage in Go.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The only mention of slices in the given context is in the `limit.go` file, where the `slices.Contains()` function is used:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY ```go
# CHAT_REPLY if slices.Contains(prefixedMasterAllowlist, val) {
# CHAT_REPLY     result = append(result, val)
# CHAT_REPLY }
# CHAT_REPLY ```
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY This suggests that Go has a `slices` package with a `Contains` function, and that slices can be appended to using the `append` function. However, this doesn't provide a comprehensive explanation of how slices work in Go.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To accurately answer how slices work in Go, we would need more specific information or documentation about Go slices, which is not present in the given codebase context.
