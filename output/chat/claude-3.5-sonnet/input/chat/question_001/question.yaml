 question: implement a dog class

# CHAT_QUESTION implement a dog class

# CHAT_REPLY Certainly! Based on the existing `Animal` interface in your codebase, we can implement a `Dog` class that extends this interface. Here's a high-level implementation:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY ```typescript
# CHAT_REPLY class Dog implements Animal {
# CHAT_REPLY     name: string;
# CHAT_REPLY     age: number;
# CHAT_REPLY     breed: string;
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY     constructor(name: string, age: number, breed: string) {
# CHAT_REPLY         this.name = name;
# CHAT_REPLY         this.age = age;
# CHAT_REPLY         this.breed = breed;
# CHAT_REPLY     }
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY     bark(): void {
# CHAT_REPLY         console.log(`${this.name} says: Woof!`);
# CHAT_REPLY     }
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY     fetch(): void {
# CHAT_REPLY         console.log(`${this.name} is fetching the ball!`);
# CHAT_REPLY     }
# CHAT_REPLY }
# CHAT_REPLY ```
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY This `Dog` class implements the `Animal` interface, including the required `name` and `age` properties. It also adds a `breed` property specific to dogs. The class includes a constructor to initialize these properties and two methods (`bark` and `fetch`) that represent typical dog behaviors. This implementation provides a solid foundation for creating and working with dog objects in your TypeScript codebase.
