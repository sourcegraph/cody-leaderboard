# CHAT_QUESTION See zoekt repo find location of tensor function

# CHAT_REPLY I apologize, but after reviewing the provided codebase context, I couldn't find any specific mention or implementation of a tensor function in the Zoekt codebase. The code snippets provided are primarily related to search functionality, indexing, and query evaluation in Zoekt.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Zoekt is a fast text search engine designed for source code, but it doesn't appear to have any tensor-specific functionality based on the given context. The main components we can see are:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. Search and indexing logic
# CHAT_REPLY 2. Query simplification and evaluation
# CHAT_REPLY 3. Match tree construction and traversal
# CHAT_REPLY 4. File and repository matching
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you're looking for tensor functionality, it's possible that it might be in a different part of the codebase that wasn't included in the provided context. Alternatively, it's possible that Zoekt doesn't have any tensor-specific functionality, as its primary purpose is fast text search for source code repositories.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you have a specific use case or more context about why you're looking for tensor functionality in Zoekt, please provide more details, and I'll try to help you further.
