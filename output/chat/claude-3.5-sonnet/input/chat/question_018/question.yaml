 question: See zoekt repo find location of tensor function
# CHAT
# CHAT_REPLY I apologize, but I cannot answer your question based solely on the provided code snippet. The given code is from a file named `watcher.go` in a package called `conf`, and it does not contain any information about a tensor function or the Zoekt repository.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The code snippet you've shared is related to configuration watching and restarting services based on configuration changes. It doesn't contain any references to Zoekt or tensor functions.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To find the location of a tensor function in the Zoekt repository, you would need to:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. Access the Zoekt repository
# CHAT_REPLY 2. Search through its codebase for tensor-related functionality
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Without access to the Zoekt repository or any additional context about its structure, I cannot provide the specific location of a tensor function. If you have access to the Zoekt repository, you might want to search for files with names related to tensors or look in directories that handle search or indexing functionality, as these are areas where tensor operations might be used in a search engine like Zoekt.
