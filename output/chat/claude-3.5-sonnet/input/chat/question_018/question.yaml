# CHAT_QUESTION See zoekt repo find location of tensor function

# CHAT_REPLY While I don't see a specific "tensor" function in the provided codebase context, I can offer some guidance on how to find such a function or similar functionality in the Zoekt repository:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. Search the codebase: Use Zoekt's own search functionality to look for "tensor" or related terms across the entire repository. This might reveal any tensor-related functions or implementations.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. Check math-related packages: Tensor operations are often part of mathematical or machine learning libraries. Look for packages or files related to math, linear algebra, or machine learning within the Zoekt codebase.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. Examine scoring and ranking algorithms: Zoekt uses various scoring methods for search results. The `scoreFile` and `scoreFileUsingBM25` functions in the `eval.go` file might be relevant starting points for understanding how Zoekt handles numerical computations.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. Investigate index structures: Tensor-like operations might be used in the indexing process. Examine the `indexData` struct and related methods in the provided code snippets.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. Look into query processing: The query evaluation logic, particularly in `eval.go`, might use tensor-like operations for efficient searching and matching.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 6. Check dependencies: If Zoekt uses tensor operations, they might be imported from external libraries. Review the project's dependencies and import statements.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you can't find a specific tensor function, it's possible that Zoekt doesn't use tensor operations directly, or they might be abstracted under different terminology. Consider clarifying what specific tensor-related functionality you're looking for to narrow down the search.
