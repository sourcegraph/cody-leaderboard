 question: See zoekt repo find location of tensor function

# CHAT_QUESTION See zoekt repo find location of tensor function

# CHAT_REPLY I've reviewed the codebase context provided, but I don't see a specific tensor function in the Zoekt repository based on the files shown. The Zoekt codebase appears to be focused on text search functionality rather than tensor operations.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY However, if you're looking for core search functionality, you might want to examine the `Search` method in the `eval.go` file. This method implements the main search logic for Zoekt.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you're interested in how Zoekt handles matching and scoring, you could look at:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. The `gatherMatches` function in `eval.go`
# CHAT_REPLY 2. The `scoreFile` method (which is mentioned but not fully visible in the provided context)
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY For more specific functionality, you might need to explore other parts of the Zoekt codebase that weren't included in the provided context. Is there a particular aspect of the search functionality you're interested in?
