# CHAT_QUESTION See zoekt repo find location of tensor function

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided codebase context, I don't see a specific tensor function in the Zoekt repository. Zoekt is primarily a fast text search engine designed for searching source code.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The codebase includes functionality for indexing, searching, and evaluating queries across repositories. It has components for handling regular expressions, substring matching, and various types of search queries.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY While there isn't a direct reference to tensor operations, Zoekt does include sophisticated matching and scoring algorithms. For example, the `gatherMatches` function in the `eval.go` file collects and processes matches from documents.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you're looking for tensor-related functionality, you might want to explore other repositories or libraries specifically designed for numerical computing or machine learning tasks. Zoekt's focus is on efficient text search rather than tensor operations.
