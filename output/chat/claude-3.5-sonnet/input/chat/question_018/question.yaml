# CHAT_QUESTION See zoekt repo find location of tensor function

# CHAT_REPLY I apologize, but after carefully reviewing the provided codebase context, I couldn't find any specific mention or implementation of a tensor function in the Zoekt codebase. The given files mainly deal with search functionality, indexing, and query evaluation.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The provided code snippets are primarily focused on:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. Sorting and truncating search results
# CHAT_REPLY 2. Simplifying and evaluating search queries
# CHAT_REPLY 3. Matching and scoring search results
# CHAT_REPLY 4. Handling regular expressions and substring matches
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY There is no explicit reference to tensors or tensor-related functions in the given context. If there is indeed a tensor function in the Zoekt repository, it's likely located in a different part of the codebase that wasn't included in the provided context.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you're looking for tensor functionality, you might want to search in other parts of the Zoekt codebase or consider if you might be thinking of a different project. Zoekt appears to be primarily a text search engine for source code, and tensor operations are not typically part of such systems.
