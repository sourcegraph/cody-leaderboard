# CHAT_QUESTION See zoekt repo find location of tensor function

# CHAT_REPLY I've reviewed the provided codebase context, but I don't see any specific tensor function in the Zoekt codebase. Zoekt is primarily a fast text search engine for source code, and doesn't appear to have tensor-related functionality.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The main components we can see in the provided code are related to search indexing, query evaluation, and result processing. For example, there are functions for simplifying queries, searching through indexed data, and gathering matches.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you're looking for tensor functionality, you might want to check other repositories or libraries that are specifically designed for machine learning or numerical computations. Zoekt is focused on text search rather than tensor operations.
