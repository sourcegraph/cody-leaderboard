# CHAT_QUESTION what does @limit.go do?

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided code in limit.go, this file defines several structures and functions related to rate limiting and concurrency control for an actor-based system, likely in the context of a service called Cody Gateway. Here's a summary of what limit.go does:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. Defines a `RateLimit` struct that includes fields for allowed models, limit values, intervals, and concurrent request limits.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. Provides a `NewRateLimitWithPercentageConcurrency` function to create a new `RateLimit` with calculated concurrency limits based on a daily percentage.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. Implements an `IsValid` method for `RateLimit` to check if the rate limit configuration is valid.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. Defines an `EvaluateAllowedModels` method to determine which models an actor is allowed to use based on a master allowlist.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. Implements a `concurrencyLimiter` struct and associated methods to enforce concurrent request limits using Redis as a backend.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 6. Defines an `ErrConcurrencyLimitExceeded` error type to handle cases where concurrency limits are exceeded, including methods to generate error messages and write HTTP responses.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 7. Implements an `updateOnErrorLimiter` struct that wraps another limiter and attempts to update the actor's information if certain access errors occur.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY These components work together to provide rate limiting and concurrency control mechanisms for the Cody Gateway service, allowing for fine-grained control over resource usage and access to different models for different actors.
