# CHAT_QUESTION what does @limit.go do?

# CHAT_REPLY The limit.go file provides functionality for sorting, truncating, and limiting search results in a code search system. Here's a high-level overview of its main components and purposes:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. SortAndTruncateFiles: This function sorts and truncates a list of FileMatch results based on the provided SearchOptions.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. DisplayTruncator: A type that represents a function for enforcing document and match display limits by truncating and mutating search results.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. NewDisplayTruncator: Creates a new DisplayTruncator based on the given SearchOptions, which can be used to enforce limits on the number of documents and matches displayed.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. limitMatches: A helper function that limits the number of matches in a list of FileMatch results, supporting both chunk-based and line-based matching.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. limitChunkMatches and limitLineMatches: These functions handle the specific logic for limiting chunk-based and line-based matches, respectively.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The code in this file is designed to help manage and control the amount of information displayed in search results, ensuring that the output remains within specified limits. This is particularly useful for large codebases or when dealing with numerous search results, as it helps maintain performance and prevents overwhelming the user with excessive information.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To use this functionality in your project, you would typically:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. Define your SearchOptions with desired limits.
# CHAT_REPLY 2. Use SortAndTruncateFiles or create a DisplayTruncator to process your search results.
# CHAT_REPLY 3. Apply the truncation logic to your FileMatch results before displaying them to the user.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY This approach allows for efficient handling of search results while providing a controlled and manageable output for the end-user.
