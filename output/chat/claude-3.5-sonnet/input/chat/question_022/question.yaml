# CHAT_REPLY 1. `SortAndTruncateFiles`: This function sorts and truncates a list of `FileMatch` results based on the provided search options.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. `DisplayTruncator`: This is a type definition for a function that enforces document and match display limits by truncating and mutating the input.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. `NewDisplayTruncator`: This function creates a new `DisplayTruncator` based on the provided search options. It enforces limits on the number of documents and matches to display.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. `limitMatches`: This function limits the number of matches in a list of `FileMatch` results based on a given limit and whether to chunk matches or not.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. `limitChunkMatches`: This function limits the number of `ChunkMatches` in a given `FileMatch`, truncating the content and symbol information as needed.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 6. `limitLineMatches`: This function limits the number of `LineMatches` in a given `FileMatch`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The file primarily deals with managing the display of search results, ensuring that the number of documents, matches, and lines shown adheres to the specified limits in the search options. This is useful for controlling the amount of data returned and displayed to the user, which can be important for performance and usability in large codebases or when dealing with many search results.
