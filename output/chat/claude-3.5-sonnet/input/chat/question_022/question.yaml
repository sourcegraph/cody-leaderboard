# CHAT_QUESTION what does @limit.go do?

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided codebase context from limit.go, this file defines functions and types related to limiting and truncating search results. Here's a summary of what limit.go does:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. It defines a `SortAndTruncateFiles` function that sorts and truncates a list of `FileMatch` objects based on given search options.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. It introduces a `DisplayTruncator` type, which is a function that enforces document and match display limits by truncating and mutating search results.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. It provides a `NewDisplayTruncator` function that creates a `DisplayTruncator` based on the provided search options. This truncator enforces limits on the maximum number of documents and matches to display.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. It implements `limitMatches`, `limitChunkMatches`, and `limitLineMatches` functions that apply limits to the number of matches in search results, either by chunks or by lines.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. The file handles two types of limits:
# CHAT_REPLY    - Document limit: restricts the total number of file matches returned.
# CHAT_REPLY    - Match limit: restricts the total number of matches across all files.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 6. It provides functionality to truncate the content of matches when necessary, ensuring that the limits are respected while maintaining the integrity of the search results.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY In summary, limit.go is responsible for managing and enforcing limits on search results, ensuring that the output doesn't exceed specified thresholds for the number of documents and matches displayed.
