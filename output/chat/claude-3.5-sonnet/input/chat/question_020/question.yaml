 question: explain @README.md
# CHAT
# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided codebase context from the README.md file, I can explain the following:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. The file is describing a package called "@sourcegraph/cody-agent".
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. This package implements a JSON-RPC (Remote Procedure Call) server.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. The purpose of this server is to interact with Cody, which appears to be an AI or software tool developed by Sourcegraph.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. The interaction with Cody happens via standard input (stdin) and standard output (stdout).
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. The primary intention of this package is to be used by non-ECMAScript clients. ECMAScript is the standardized version of JavaScript, so this implies the package is meant for use with programming languages or environments other than JavaScript/TypeScript.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 6. Specifically, it mentions that this package is intended for use with JetBrains and NeoVim plugins. JetBrains produces a range of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), while NeoVim is a text editor.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY In summary, this README.md is introducing a package that allows non-JavaScript tools, particularly JetBrains IDEs and NeoVim, to communicate with Cody (a Sourcegraph tool) using a JSON-RPC server that operates over standard input and output.
