 question: explain @README.md
# CHAT
# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided codebase context from the README.md file, I can explain the following:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. The file is describing a package called "@sourcegraph/cody-agent".
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. This package implements a JSON-RPC (Remote Procedure Call) server.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. The purpose of this server is to interact with Cody, which appears to be an AI or software tool developed by Sourcegraph.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. The interaction with Cody happens via standard input (stdin) and standard output (stdout).
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. The primary intention of this package is to be used by non-ECMAScript clients. ECMAScript is the standardized version of JavaScript, so this implies the package is meant for use with programming languages or environments other than JavaScript/TypeScript.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 6. Specifically, the README mentions two examples of intended users:
# CHAT_REPLY    - JetBrains plugins
# CHAT_REPLY    - NeoVim plugins
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY This suggests that the package is designed to allow these development environments to integrate with Cody, likely to provide AI-assisted coding features within these IDEs or text editors.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY That's all the information I can confidently provide based on the given context. The README doesn't provide any additional details about Cody's specific capabilities, how to set up or use the package, or any other technical specifics.
