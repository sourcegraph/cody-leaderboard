# CHAT_QUESTION Mind taking a second look at the file? @limit.go

# CHAT_REPLY Certainly! I'll take another look at the `limit.go` file and provide a summary of its key components and functionality.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The `limit.go` file contains several important functions and types related to limiting and truncating search results in the Zoekt search engine. Here's an overview of the main components:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. `SortAndTruncateFiles`: A convenience function that sorts and truncates file matches based on search options.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. `DisplayTruncator`: A type definition for a function that enforces document and match display limits.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. `NewDisplayTruncator`: Creates a new DisplayTruncator based on the provided search options.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. `limitMatches`: Limits the number of matches in a slice of FileMatch objects.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. `limitChunkMatches`: Limits the number of ChunkMatches in a given FileMatch.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 6. `limitLineMatches`: Limits the number of LineMatches in a given FileMatch.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The file implements various strategies for limiting search results, including:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY - Limiting the total number of documents displayed
# CHAT_REPLY - Limiting the total number of matches displayed
# CHAT_REPLY - Truncating content and adjusting ranges when limiting chunk matches
# CHAT_REPLY - Handling both chunk-based and line-based match limiting
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY These functions work together to ensure that search results are manageable and don't exceed specified limits, which is crucial for performance and usability in a code search engine like Zoekt.
