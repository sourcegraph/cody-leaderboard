# CHAT_QUESTION Mind taking a second look at the file? @limit.go

# CHAT_REPLY Certainly! The `limit.go` file in the Zoekt codebase contains important functionality for managing search result limits and truncation. Here's a high-level overview of its key components:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. `SortAndTruncateFiles`: A convenience function that sorts and truncates file matches based on search options.
