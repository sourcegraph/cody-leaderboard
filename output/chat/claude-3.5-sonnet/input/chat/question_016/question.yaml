# CHAT_QUESTION Mind taking a second look at the file? @limit.go

# CHAT_REPLY Certainly! I'll take another look at the `limit.go` file and provide a summary of its key components and functionality.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The `limit.go` file contains several functions related to sorting and truncating search results in the Zoekt search engine. Here are the main components:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. `SortAndTruncateFiles`: A convenience function that sorts and truncates file matches based on search options.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. `DisplayTruncator`: A type definition for a function that enforces document and match display limits.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. `NewDisplayTruncator`: Creates a new DisplayTruncator based on the provided search options.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. `limitMatches`: Applies limits to the number of matches in file results.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. `limitChunkMatches`: Limits the number of ChunkMatches in a given FileMatch.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 6. `limitLineMatches`: Limits the number of LineMatches in a given FileMatch.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The file implements logic to enforce various limits on search results, such as:
# CHAT_REPLY - Maximum number of documents to display
# CHAT_REPLY - Maximum number of matches to display
# CHAT_REPLY - Chunked or line-based match limiting
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY It also handles the truncation of content and adjusts related fields (like Ranges and SymbolInfo) when limiting matches.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The code is designed to work with the Zoekt search engine's data structures and integrates with the broader search functionality of the system.
