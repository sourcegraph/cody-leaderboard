# CHAT_QUESTION Mind taking a second look at the file? @limit.go

# CHAT_REPLY Certainly! I'd be happy to take another look at the limit.go file. This file contains important functionality for sorting and truncating search results in the Zoekt codebase. Here are some key points about the file:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. It defines the SortAndTruncateFiles function, which is a convenience wrapper around SortFiles and DisplayTruncator.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. The DisplayTruncator type is a stateful function that enforces document and match display limits.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. NewDisplayTruncator creates a DisplayTruncator based on the provided SearchOptions.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. The file includes functions for limiting matches in both chunk and line formats.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. It handles the logic for truncating content and ranges when enforcing limits.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Is there a specific aspect of the limit.go file you'd like me to focus on or explain further?
