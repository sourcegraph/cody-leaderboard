# CHAT_QUESTION Mind taking a second look at the file? @limit.go

# CHAT_REPLY Certainly! I'll take another look at the `limit.go` file for you.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The `limit.go` file is part of the `actor` package and contains several important structures and functions related to rate limiting and concurrency control. Here's a summary of its key components:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. `RateLimit` struct: Defines rate limiting parameters including allowed models, limit, interval, and concurrent request settings.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. `NewRateLimitWithPercentageConcurrency` function: Creates a new `RateLimit` with concurrent request limits based on a percentage of the daily limit.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. `EvaluateAllowedModels` method: Determines which models are allowed based on a master allowlist and the actor's allowlist.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. `concurrencyLimiter` struct: Implements concurrent request limiting.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. `ErrConcurrencyLimitExceeded` struct: Represents an error when the concurrency limit is exceeded.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 6. `updateOnErrorLimiter` struct: Wraps another limiter and updates the actor's information if certain errors occur.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The file includes implementations for rate limiting, concurrency control, and error handling related to these limits. It also provides methods for trying to acquire permissions within these limits and for reporting usage.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Is there any specific part of this file you'd like me to focus on or explain in more detail?
