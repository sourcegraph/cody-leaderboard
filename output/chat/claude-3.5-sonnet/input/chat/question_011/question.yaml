# CHAT_QUESTION What does directory watcher do?

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided codebase context, specifically the `mocked/codebase_context/shards/watcher.go` file, the DirectoryWatcher is responsible for monitoring a directory for changes in shard files (files with the `.zoekt` extension) and managing the loading and unloading of these shards. Here's a breakdown of its main functions:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. Initialization:
# CHAT_REPLY    - It's created with a directory to watch and a shardLoader interface.
# CHAT_REPLY    - It starts a goroutine that scans the directory and sets up a file system watcher.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. Scanning:
# CHAT_REPLY    - The `scan()` method looks for `.zoekt` files in the specified directory.
# CHAT_REPLY    - It keeps track of the latest version of each shard.
# CHAT_REPLY    - It compares the modification times of the files with its internal timestamps.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. Loading and Unloading:
# CHAT_REPLY    - New or modified shards are loaded using the `loader.load()` method.
# CHAT_REPLY    - Deleted shards are unloaded using the `loader.drop()` method.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. Continuous Watching:
# CHAT_REPLY    - It uses `fsnotify` to watch for file system events in the directory.
# CHAT_REPLY    - When changes are detected, it triggers another scan.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. Version Management:
# CHAT_REPLY    - It extracts version information from shard filenames and ensures only the latest versions are loaded.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 6. Graceful Shutdown:
# CHAT_REPLY    - The `Stop()` method allows for graceful shutdown of the watcher.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The DirectoryWatcher is designed to keep the set of loaded shards up-to-date with the contents of the directory, automatically handling additions, deletions, and updates to shard files.
