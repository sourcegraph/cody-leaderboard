# CHAT_QUESTION What does directory watcher do?

# CHAT_REPLY The DirectoryWatcher in the codebase is responsible for monitoring a specified directory for changes in shard files (*.zoekt files). Here's what it does:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. It scans the directory for shard files and loads them initially.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. It sets up a file system watcher to detect changes in the directory.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. When changes are detected (new files, modified files, or deleted files), it triggers a scan.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. During a scan, it:
# CHAT_REPLY    - Loads new or modified shard files
# CHAT_REPLY    - Unloads deleted shard files
# CHAT_REPLY    - Keeps track of file timestamps to determine changes
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. It handles version control of shard files, ensuring only the latest versions are loaded.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 6. It provides a mechanism to wait until the initial scan is complete (WaitUntilReady method).
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 7. It can be stopped gracefully, cleaning up resources.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The DirectoryWatcher is an important component for keeping the search index up-to-date with the latest shard files, enabling efficient and current search capabilities in the Zoekt search engine.
