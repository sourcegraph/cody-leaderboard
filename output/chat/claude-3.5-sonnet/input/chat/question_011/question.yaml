# CHAT_QUESTION What does directory watcher do?

# CHAT_REPLY The DirectoryWatcher in the Zoekt codebase is a crucial component that monitors a specified directory for changes in shard files. Here's a high-level overview of its functionality:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. Initialization: It sets up a watcher for a given directory and prepares to load shards.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. Scanning: The watcher scans the directory for .zoekt files, which are Zoekt's shard files.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. Version Management: It extracts and manages version information from shard filenames, ensuring that the latest compatible versions are used.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. Loading and Unloading: The watcher determines which shards need to be loaded or unloaded based on file modifications and deletions.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. Continuous Monitoring: It uses fsnotify to watch for real-time changes in the directory.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 6. Efficient Updates: The watcher batches multiple file system events to minimize unnecessary scans.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 7. Error Handling: It manages and logs errors that occur during the watching process.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 8. Graceful Shutdown: The watcher can be stopped cleanly, ensuring all resources are properly released.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY This DirectoryWatcher plays a key role in keeping the Zoekt search index up-to-date by dynamically managing shard files as they change on disk, contributing to the efficiency and real-time nature of the Zoekt search engine.
