# CHAT_QUESTION What does directory watcher do?

# CHAT_REPLY I apologize, but based on the codebase context provided, there is no specific information about a "directory watcher" or its functionality. The given context doesn't mention or describe any directory watching feature or component. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The provided context includes information about Zoekt (a text search engine), some TypeScript interfaces, a Go package, and a README for a Cody Agent. However, none of these explicitly mention or describe a directory watcher.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you have a specific question about something mentioned in the provided context, I'd be happy to help with that. Otherwise, I don't have enough information to answer about a directory watcher's functionality.
