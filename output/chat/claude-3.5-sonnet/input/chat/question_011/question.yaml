# CHAT_QUESTION What does directory watcher do?

# CHAT_REPLY The DirectoryWatcher in the provided codebase context is responsible for monitoring a specified directory for changes in shard files (files with the .zoekt extension). Here's what it does:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. It scans the directory for existing shard files and loads them initially.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. It sets up a file system watcher to detect changes in the directory.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. When new shard files are added or existing ones are modified, it loads them using the provided shardLoader.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. If shard files are deleted, it unloads them using the loader's drop method.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. It keeps track of file timestamps to determine which files have changed and need to be reloaded.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 6. It handles version checking of shard files to ensure compatibility with the current index format.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 7. It provides a mechanism to wait until the initial scan and watch setup are complete.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 8. It can be gracefully stopped when no longer needed.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The DirectoryWatcher is an essential component for maintaining an up-to-date index of shards in the Zoekt search engine, allowing for dynamic updates as the underlying data changes.
