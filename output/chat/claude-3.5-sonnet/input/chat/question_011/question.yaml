# CHAT_QUESTION What does directory watcher do?

# CHAT_REPLY The DirectoryWatcher is a component that monitors a specific directory for changes in shard files (files with a .zoekt extension) and manages the loading and unloading of these shards. Here's a high-level overview of its functionality:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. Initialization: It sets up a watcher for a given directory and prepares to manage shard files.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. Scanning: The watcher performs an initial scan of the directory to identify existing shard files and their timestamps.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. Loading: It loads new or updated shard files into the system using a provided shardLoader interface.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. Unloading: It removes (drops) shard files that have been deleted from the directory.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. Continuous Monitoring: Using the fsnotify package, it watches for file system events in the directory.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 6. Version Management: It handles different versions of shard files, ensuring that the latest compatible version is used.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 7. Asynchronous Operation: The watcher runs in the background, allowing for non-blocking operation of the main program.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 8. Graceful Shutdown: It provides a mechanism to stop the watcher cleanly when it's no longer needed.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY This component is crucial for maintaining an up-to-date index of searchable content, especially in systems where the content is frequently changing. It ensures that the search functionality always has access to the most recent data without requiring manual intervention.
