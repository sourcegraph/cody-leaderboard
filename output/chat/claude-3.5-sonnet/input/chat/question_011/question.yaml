 question: What does directory watcher do?

# CHAT_QUESTION What does directory watcher do?

# CHAT_REPLY I apologize, but based on the codebase context provided, there is no specific information about a "directory watcher" or its functionality. The provided context doesn't contain any code or documentation related to a directory watching feature.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The context includes information about:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. A code intelligence API called Squirrel
# CHAT_REPLY 2. An Animal interface
# CHAT_REPLY 3. An Agent type
# CHAT_REPLY 4. Rate limiting and concurrency control for a Cody Gateway
# CHAT_REPLY 5. A README for a Cody Agent package
# CHAT_REPLY 6. A README for Zoekt, which is a fast text search engine for source code
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY None of these components explicitly mention or describe a directory watcher. If there is indeed a directory watcher component in the codebase, it's not included in the provided context. To answer questions about a directory watcher, we would need additional context or code snippets related to that specific feature.
