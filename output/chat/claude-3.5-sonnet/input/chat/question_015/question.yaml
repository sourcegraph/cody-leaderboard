# CHAT_QUESTION Can you look through the files and identify the conflicting packages that may be causing this?

# CHAT_REPLY I've reviewed the codebase context provided, but I don't see any conflicting packages that could be causing issues. Both files are part of the same `zoekt` package. The README.md file provides general information about the Zoekt project, while the limit.go file contains specific Go code for handling search result truncation and limits. There don't appear to be any package conflicts between these files. If you're experiencing a specific issue, it might be related to something else in the codebase that wasn't included in the provided context. Could you provide more details about the problem you're encountering?

 class: debug code
 files:
   - ../mocked/codebase_context/README.md
   - ../mocked/codebase_context/limit.go
