 question: Can you look through the files and identify the conflicting packages that may be causing this?

# CHAT_QUESTION Can you look through the files and identify the conflicting packages that may be causing this?

# CHAT_REPLY I apologize, but there is no conflict between packages evident in the provided code snippets. The codebase context you've shared includes two files:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. README.md: This is a markdown file containing project documentation, not Go code. It doesn't define any package.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. limit.go: This Go file defines its package as `package zoekt` at the very beginning.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY There's only one Go package defined in the provided code, which is the `zoekt` package. Without additional code snippets or information about conflicting packages, I cannot identify any package conflicts based solely on the given information.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you're experiencing a package conflict, it would be helpful to see the specific error message or the code where the conflict is occurring. Package conflicts typically happen when there are multiple files with different package declarations in the same directory, or when import paths are incorrect, but such issues are not apparent in the provided context.

 files:
   - ../mocked/codebase_context/README.md
   - ../mocked/codebase_context/limit.go
