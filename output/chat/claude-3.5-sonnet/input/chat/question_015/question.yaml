 question: Can you look through the files and identify the conflicting packages that may be causing this?

# CHAT_QUESTION Can you look through the files and identify the conflicting packages that may be causing this?

# CHAT_REPLY I apologize, but there doesn't appear to be any conflicting packages in the provided code snippets. Both files are part of the same `zoekt` package. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The `README.md` file doesn't contain any Go code, it's just documentation for the Zoekt project. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The `limit.go` file contains Go code and it's explicitly declared to be part of the `zoekt` package at the top of the file:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY ```go
# CHAT_REPLY package zoekt
# CHAT_REPLY ```
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY There are no other package declarations in the provided code that could cause conflicts. If you're experiencing package conflicts, they must be coming from other files or parts of the codebase that weren't included in the context provided. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To identify conflicting packages, you would typically look for:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. Multiple files declaring different package names in the same directory.
# CHAT_REPLY 2. Import statements that might be importing packages with similar names from different locations.
# CHAT_REPLY 3. Name clashes between imported packages and local declarations.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY However, none of these issues are present in the code snippets you've provided. If you're encountering a specific error or issue related to package conflicts, please provide more details about the error message or the specific files involved.
