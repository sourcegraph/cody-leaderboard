# CHAT_QUESTION Can you look through the files and identify the conflicting packages that may be causing this?

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the codebase context provided, there don't appear to be any conflicting packages causing issues. The files shown are part of the same `zoekt` package and seem to be working together cohesively. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The `README.md` file provides an overview of the Zoekt project, which is a fast text search engine for source code. It includes instructions for installation, indexing, and searching.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The `limit.go` file contains functions related to sorting, truncating, and limiting search results. These functions work with the `SearchOptions` struct and implement various display limits for search results.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Both files are part of the Zoekt project and serve complementary purposes. The `limit.go` file implements some of the functionality described in the README, specifically related to managing search results.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you're experiencing any issues, they're likely not due to conflicting packages based on the information provided. The code appears to be well-structured and part of a unified package.
