# CHAT_QUESTION Can you look through the files and identify the conflicting packages that may be causing this?

# CHAT_REPLY I've reviewed the provided codebase context, but I don't see any conflicting packages that could be causing issues. The files shown are:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. README.md - This is a markdown file containing project information and instructions, not Go code.
# CHAT_REPLY 2. limit.go - This file is in the `zoekt` package and contains functions for sorting, truncating, and limiting search results.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Both files are part of the Zoekt project and don't show any package conflicts. The Go file (limit.go) is properly structured within the `zoekt` package. Without more information about a specific error or issue you're encountering, I can't identify any conflicts based on the given context.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you're experiencing a particular problem, could you provide more details about the error or the specific files where you're seeing conflicts? That would help me give a more targeted answer.
