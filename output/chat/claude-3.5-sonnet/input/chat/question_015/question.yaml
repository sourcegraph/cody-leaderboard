# CHAT_QUESTION Can you look through the files and identify the conflicting packages that may be causing this?

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided codebase context, I don't see any conflicting packages that would cause issues. The files you've shared are part of the same `zoekt` package and seem to be working together cohesively. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The `limit.go` file contains functions for sorting, truncating, and limiting search results, which are likely used in conjunction with other parts of the Zoekt search engine. These functions include:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. `SortAndTruncateFiles`
# CHAT_REPLY 2. `NewDisplayTruncator`
# CHAT_REPLY 3. `limitMatches`
# CHAT_REPLY 4. `limitChunkMatches`
# CHAT_REPLY 5. `limitLineMatches`
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY These functions work together to manage the display of search results, enforcing limits on the number of documents and matches shown.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The README.md file provides an overview of the Zoekt project, including installation instructions, usage guidelines, and information about the fork maintained by Sourcegraph.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you're experiencing any specific issues or errors, it would be helpful to know more about the problem you're encountering. Without more information about a particular conflict or error, I can assure you that the files you've shared appear to be properly organized within the same package and don't show signs of conflicting imports or package declarations.
