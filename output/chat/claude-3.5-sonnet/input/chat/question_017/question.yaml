# CHAT_QUESTION Why does this project use the MIT license?

# CHAT_REPLY I apologize, but I don't have any information about the project's license in the provided codebase context. The README.md file and the Go code snippet do not mention anything about licensing. Without additional context or information, I cannot make any statements about why this project uses the MIT license or if it uses the MIT license at all.

 files:
   - ../mocked/codebase_context/limit.go
   - ../mocked/codebase_context/README.md
