# CHAT_QUESTION Why does this project use the MIT license?

# CHAT_REPLY I apologize, but based on the provided codebase context, there is no explicit information about the project's license or why it uses the MIT license. The README.md file and the Go code snippet do not mention licensing information.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The README mainly contains information about how to use Zoekt, including instructions for indexing, searching, and installation. It also provides some background on the project and its fork status, but does not discuss licensing.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If the project does use the MIT license, that information would typically be found in a separate LICENSE file or sometimes mentioned at the top of source files, neither of which are present in the given context. To accurately answer why this project uses the MIT license, we would need additional information or access to the project's license file.
