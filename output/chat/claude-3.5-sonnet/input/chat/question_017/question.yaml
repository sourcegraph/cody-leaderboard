 question: Why does this project use the MIT license?

# CHAT_QUESTION Why does this project use the MIT license?

# CHAT_REPLY I apologize, but I don't see any information about licensing in the provided codebase context. The README.md file doesn't mention the MIT license or any other license. Without additional information about the project's licensing, I can't answer why this project uses the MIT license or confirm if it actually does use that license.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The README mainly contains information about how to use Zoekt (a fast text search engine for source code), including instructions for indexing, searching, and setting up the search service. It also mentions that this is a Sourcegraph fork of the original Google project, but it doesn't provide licensing details.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you have additional information about the project's licensing that isn't included in the provided context, please share it, and I'll be happy to help further.
