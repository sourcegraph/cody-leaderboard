# CHAT_QUESTION Why does this project use the MIT license?

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the codebase context provided, I don't see any specific information about the project's license. The README.md file doesn't mention the MIT license or any other license type. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY However, it's common for open-source projects to use the MIT license due to its simplicity and permissiveness. The MIT license allows for free use, modification, and distribution of the software, which aligns well with open-source principles.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you're certain that this project uses the MIT license, it's likely because the maintainers want to encourage widespread use and contribution to the project while providing legal protection for themselves. The MIT license is known for being short, easy to understand, and very permissive, which makes it attractive for many open-source projects.
