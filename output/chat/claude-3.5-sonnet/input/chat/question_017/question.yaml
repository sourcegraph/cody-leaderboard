 question: Why does this project use the MIT license?
# CHAT
# CHAT_REPLY I apologize, but I don't have any information in the provided codebase context about the project's license or why a specific license was chosen. The given code snippets and README don't mention anything about licensing. Without additional context or information about the project's licensing, I cannot make any statements about why this project uses the MIT license or if it even uses the MIT license at all.
