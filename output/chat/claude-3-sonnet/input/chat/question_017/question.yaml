# CHAT_QUESTION Why does this project use the MIT license?

# CHAT_REPLY Unfortunately, the provided codebase context does not mention anything about the license used by this project. The README file provides an overview of the Zoekt project, its features, and instructions for using it, but it does not discuss the rationale behind choosing the MIT license specifically.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Most open source projects choose permissive licenses like MIT or Apache to allow the software to be freely used, modified, and distributed by others. However, without any explicit mention in the codebase or documentation, I can only speculate about the reasons for choosing MIT over other licenses for the Zoekt project.
