# CHAT_QUESTION Why does this project use the MIT license?

# CHAT_REPLY Unfortunately, the provided codebase context does not mention anything about the license or reasons for choosing a particular license. The README file provides an overview of the project and instructions for using it, but does not discuss licensing details. Without any information about licensing in the codebase, I cannot provide a specific reason for why this project uses the MIT license.

 files:
   - ../mocked/codebase_context/limit.go
   - ../mocked/codebase_context/README.md
