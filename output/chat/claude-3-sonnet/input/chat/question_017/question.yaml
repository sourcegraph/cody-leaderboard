# CHAT_QUESTION Why does this project use the MIT license?

# CHAT_REPLY Unfortunately, the provided codebase context does not mention anything about the license or reasons for choosing a particular license. The README file provides an overview of the Zoekt project, its features, and instructions for using it, but it does not discuss the licensing details or rationale behind the license choice.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Most open-source projects choose licenses like MIT or Apache to allow free use, modification, and distribution of the software, both for commercial and non-commercial purposes. However, without any explicit information in the codebase or documentation, I cannot provide a definitive reason for why the Zoekt project uses the MIT license specifically.
