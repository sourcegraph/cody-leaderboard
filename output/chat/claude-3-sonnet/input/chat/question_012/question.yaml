 question: Is my codebase clean?

# CHAT_QUESTION Is my codebase clean?

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided codebase context, it appears that your codebase is not entirely clean. Here are a few observations:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. The codebase contains files from different programming languages, including TypeScript (`.ts` files) and Go (`.go` files). This could indicate that the codebase is a mix of different projects or components.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. The `mocked/enhanced_context` directory contains files with simple interface definitions, which may be used for testing or mocking purposes.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. The `mocked/codebase_context` directory contains more substantial Go code files, such as `limit.go`, which appears to be part of the Zoekt project. However, these files are located in a directory named `mocked`, which suggests that they may not be the actual production code.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. The `README.md` file provides instructions for working with the Zoekt project, including indexing, searching, and installation. This indicates that the codebase is related to the Zoekt project, but it's unclear if the provided files represent the complete codebase or just a subset.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. The `README.md` file mentions that this is a fork of the original `google/zoekt` repository, and it contains some Sourcegraph-specific changes. This suggests that the codebase may include modifications or additions specific to Sourcegraph's needs.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Overall, while the provided codebase context includes files from the Zoekt project, it appears to be a mix of different components, possibly including mocked or test files, and may not represent the complete, production-ready codebase. To determine if the codebase is truly clean, you would need to have a better understanding of the project structure, the purpose of each file or directory, and whether the provided files are intended for production use or testing/mocking purposes.
