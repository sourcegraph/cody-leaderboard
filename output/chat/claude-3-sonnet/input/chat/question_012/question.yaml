 question: Is my codebase clean?

# CHAT_QUESTION Is my codebase clean?

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided codebase context, it appears that your codebase is not entirely clean. The codebase contains a mix of TypeScript and Go files, which suggests that it is not a single, focused project. Additionally, the presence of the `mocked/` directory implies that some files or functionality are being mocked or simulated, rather than representing the actual production code.

# CHAT_REPLY Furthermore, the `README.md` file mentions that this is a fork of the `google/zoekt` repository, and it contains some Sourcegraph-specific changes and additions. The README also acknowledges that the codebase is not entirely clean, stating:

# CHAT_REPLY Originally this fork contained some changes that do not make sense to upstream and or have not yet been upstreamed. However, this is now the defacto source for Zoekt. This section will remain for historical reasons and contains outdated information. It can be removed once the dust settles on moving from google/zoekt to sourcegraph/zoekt.

# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY While the codebase appears to be functional and actively maintained, it seems to be a combination of different projects and codebases, with some parts being mocked or simulated, and some parts being specific to Sourcegraph's needs. Therefore, based on the provided context, it would be accurate to say that your codebase is not entirely clean or focused on a single project.
