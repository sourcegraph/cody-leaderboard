# CHAT_QUESTION What does directory watcher do?

# CHAT_REPLY Unfortunately, none of the provided code snippets mention or implement a directory watcher functionality. The code seems to be related to a code intelligence API called "Squirrel", some interfaces for representing animals and agents, rate limiting logic, and some documentation about the Zoekt search engine. Without any code related to a directory watcher, I cannot provide any details about what it does in this codebase.
