# CHAT_QUESTION What does directory watcher do?

# CHAT_REPLY Unfortunately, none of the provided code snippets mention or describe a "directory watcher" functionality. The code seems to be related to the Zoekt code search engine, with files covering things like indexing repositories, handling search requests, rate limiting, and interacting with the Cody AI assistant. Without any specific code related to a directory watcher, I cannot provide details on what it does in this codebase.

 files:
   - ../mocked/enhanced_context/squirrel.ts
   - ../mocked/enhanced_context/animal.ts
   - ../mocked/enhanced_context/agent.go
   - ../mocked/enhanced_context/limit.go
   - ../mocked/enhanced_context/README.md
   - ../mocked/codebase_context/README.md
