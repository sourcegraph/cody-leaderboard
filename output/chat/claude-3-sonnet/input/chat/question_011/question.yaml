# CHAT_QUESTION What does directory watcher do?

# CHAT_REPLY The DirectoryWatcher is responsible for monitoring a directory for changes to shard files (files with the .zoekt extension) and notifying a shardLoader when new shard files are added, existing ones are modified, or shard files are deleted. It accomplishes this by using the fsnotify package to watch the specified directory for file system events. When events are detected, it scans the directory, compares the current state with the previously recorded state, and calls the shardLoader's load and drop methods accordingly to load new or updated shard files and unload deleted ones.
