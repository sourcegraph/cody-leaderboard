# CHAT_QUESTION what does this regex do? \n/a|e|i|o|u/\n

# CHAT_REPLY Certainly! The provided regular expression `/n/a|e|i|o|u//n` matches any string that contains the letter 'n' followed by one of the vowels 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u', and then another 'n'. This pattern is case-sensitive, so it will only match strings with the specified combination of characters in the correct case.
