 question: where do we test the grpc chunker

# CHAT_QUESTION where do we test the grpc chunker

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided context, it seems there is no specific test for the gRPC chunker implementation. The provided code snippet `type server struct { grpc_testing.UnimplementedTestServiceServer }` is a struct definition for a gRPC server, but it does not provide any information about testing the chunker functionality.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The README file mentions that this is a fork of the Google Zoekt project and provides instructions for building, indexing, and searching the code. However, it does not mention any details about testing the gRPC chunker specifically.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Without more context or code related to the chunker implementation and its tests, I cannot provide a specific answer about where the gRPC chunker is tested in this codebase.
