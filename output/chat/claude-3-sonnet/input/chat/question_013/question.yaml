 question: where do we test the grpc chunker
# CHAT
# CHAT_QUESTION where do we test the grpc chunker

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided context, there doesn't seem to be any information about testing a gRPC chunker specifically. The only relevant file shown is `chunker_test.go`, which defines a `server` struct that embeds the `UnimplementedTestServiceServer` from the `grpc_testing` package.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Without more context from the codebase, it's difficult to determine where the gRPC chunker functionality is implemented and tested. Typically, tests for gRPC services would be located in the same package as the service implementation, or in a separate `_test` package within the same directory.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To find the tests for the gRPC chunker, you would need to search the codebase for files that import the package containing the chunker implementation and define test cases related to its functionality.

 files:
   - ../mocked/codebase_context/README.md
   - ../mocked/enhanced_context/chunker_test.go
