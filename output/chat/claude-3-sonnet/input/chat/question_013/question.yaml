# CHAT_QUESTION where do we test the grpc chunker

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the codebase context provided, it appears that the gRPC chunker is tested in the file `mocked/enhanced_context/chunker_test.go`. This file defines a `server` struct that embeds the `grpc_testing.UnimplementedTestServiceServer`, which suggests that it is used for testing the gRPC service implementation related to the chunker functionality.
