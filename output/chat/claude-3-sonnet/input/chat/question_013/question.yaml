 question: where do we test the grpc chunker
# CHAT
# CHAT_QUESTION where do we test the grpc chunker

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided codebase context, there is no explicit mention of testing the gRPC chunker. The context shows a `chunker_test.go` file, but without seeing the contents of that file, I cannot definitively say where the gRPC chunker is tested.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The `README.md` file provides an overview of Zoekt, a text search engine, but does not mention details about testing the gRPC chunker specifically.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The provided code snippet `type server struct { ... }` defines a `server` struct, but without more context, it's unclear if this struct is related to testing the gRPC chunker or not.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY In summary, the provided context is not sufficient to determine where the gRPC chunker is tested in this codebase.
