 question: where do we test the grpc chunker

# CHAT_QUESTION where do we test the grpc chunker

# CHAT_REPLY Absolutely. Based on the codebase context provided, the gRPC chunker is tested in the `chunker_test.go` file. This file defines a `server` struct that embeds the `grpc_testing.UnimplementedTestServiceServer` interface, which is likely used for testing the gRPC server implementation that handles chunked requests and responses.
