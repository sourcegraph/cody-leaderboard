 question: where do we test the grpc chunker

# CHAT_QUESTION where do we test the grpc chunker

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided codebase context, there doesn't seem to be any information about testing the gRPC chunker specifically. The context shows a `README.md` file explaining Zoekt, a text search engine, and a small code snippet defining a `server` struct.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Without more context from the actual codebase, I cannot pinpoint where the gRPC chunker is tested. Typically, tests for a specific component like a gRPC chunker would be located in the same package or directory as the chunker implementation itself, following common Go testing conventions (e.g., `chunker_test.go` file in the same directory as `chunker.go`).

 files:
   - ../mocked/codebase_context/README.md
   - ../mocked/enhanced_context/chunker_test.go
