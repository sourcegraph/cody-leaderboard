# CHAT_QUESTION \@zoekt describe my code.

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided codebase context, it appears that your code is related to an AI coding assistant called "Cody" developed by Sourcegraph. Here's a brief description of the relevant files:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. `squirrel.ts`: This file defines an interface called `Squirrel`, which seems to be a code intelligence API. It has a method `symbolInformation` that takes a file path and returns an object containing an array of symbols.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. `animal.ts`: This file defines a simple interface called `Animal` with properties `name` and `age`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. `agent.go`: This file is located in the `agent` package, but no additional context is provided about its contents.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. `limit.go`: This file is located in the `actor` package and appears to contain code related to rate limiting and concurrency control for the Cody Gateway. It defines structs like `RateLimit`, `concurrencyLimiter`, and `updateOnErrorLimiter`, as well as error types like `ErrConcurrencyLimitExceeded`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. `README.md`: This file provides a brief description of the `@sourcegraph/cody-agent` package, which implements a JSON-RPC server to interact with Cody via stdout/stdin, intended for non-ECMAScript clients like JetBrains and NeoVim plugins.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Overall, the provided context suggests that this codebase is part of the Sourcegraph Cody project, which is an AI coding assistant. The code deals with various aspects such as code intelligence, rate limiting, concurrency control, and client communication.
