# CHAT_QUESTION \@zoekt describe my code.

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided code context, it appears that your codebase is related to an AI coding assistant called "Cody" developed by Sourcegraph. Here's a summary of what I can gather from the code snippets:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. `squirrel.ts` defines an interface called `Squirrel` which seems to be a code intelligence API that provides symbol information for a given file.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. `animal.ts` defines a simple interface called `Animal` with properties `name` and `age`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. `agent.go` is a Go package, but the provided code snippet doesn't provide any additional context.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. `limit.go` is a Go package that appears to be related to rate limiting and concurrency control for the Cody Gateway. It defines structs like `RateLimit` and `concurrencyLimiter`, as well as error types like `ErrConcurrencyLimitExceeded`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. `README.md` provides a brief description of the `@sourcegraph/cody-agent` package, which seems to be a JSON-RPC server for interacting with Cody from non-ECMAScript clients like JetBrains and NeoVim plugins.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Overall, the codebase appears to be related to the implementation of Sourcegraph's Cody AI coding assistant, with components for code intelligence, rate limiting, concurrency control, and client integration.
