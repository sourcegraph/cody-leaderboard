# CHAT_QUESTION \@zoekt describe my code.

# CHAT_REPLY Certainly! Based on the provided codebase context, it appears that your code is related to a project called "Cody," which is a code intelligence API or assistant. Here's a high-level overview of what I can gather from the code snippets:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. The `squirrel.ts` file defines an interface called `Squirrel`, which seems to be the code intelligence API. It has a method `symbolInformation` that takes a file path and returns an object containing symbols (likely code symbols or identifiers) found in that file.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. The `animal.ts` file defines a simple interface called `Animal` with properties for `name` and `age`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. The `agent.go` file appears to be part of a Go package called `agent`, but the provided code snippet doesn't reveal much about its functionality.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. The `limit.go` file is part of a package called `actor` and contains code related to rate limiting and concurrency control for some feature or service. It defines a `RateLimit` struct with fields for allowed models, request limits, and intervals. There are also helper functions and custom error types related to rate limiting and concurrency management.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. The `README.md` file mentions a package called `@sourcegraph/cody-agent`, which seems to be a JSON-RPC server implementation for interacting with Cody via stdin/stdout, intended for non-ECMAScript clients like JetBrains and NeoVim plugins.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Overall, your codebase appears to be focused on implementing a code intelligence API or assistant called "Cody," with various components for handling rate limiting, concurrency control, and client interactions.
