# CHAT_QUESTION \@zoekt describe my code.

# CHAT_REPLY Certainly! Your codebase appears to be a collection of TypeScript and Go files related to a project called "Cody." Here's a high-level overview of what I can gather from the provided context:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The TypeScript files define interfaces for concepts like "CodeIntelligence," "Squirrel" (which seems to be a code intelligence API), and "Animal" (likely an example or unrelated interface).
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The Go files, on the other hand, seem to be part of a larger system that handles rate limiting, concurrency control, and error handling for actors (potentially AI agents or services). The `limit.go` file contains structs and functions for managing rate limits, concurrency limits, and handling related errors. It also includes logic for updating actors based on certain error conditions.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The `README.md` file suggests that this codebase is part of the `@sourcegraph/cody-agent` package, which implements a JSON-RPC server for interacting with Cody (possibly an AI assistant or service) via stdout/stdin. This package is intended for non-ECMAScript clients like JetBrains and NeoVim plugins.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Overall, it appears that this codebase is part of a larger system for managing and interacting with AI agents or services, with a focus on rate limiting, concurrency control, and error handling. The TypeScript files define interfaces related to code intelligence, while the Go files handle the backend logic for managing and interacting with these agents or services.
