# CHAT_QUESTION \@zoekt describe my code.

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided codebase context, it appears that your code is related to an AI coding assistant called "Cody" developed by Sourcegraph. Here's a brief description of the relevant files:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. `squirrel.ts`: This file defines interfaces for a code intelligence API called "Squirrel". The `Squirrel` interface has a method `symbolInformation` that takes a file path and returns information about symbols (e.g., variables, functions) in that file.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. `animal.ts`: This file defines a simple `Animal` interface with properties `name` and `age`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. `agent.go`: This file is located in the `agent` package, but no additional context is provided about its contents.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. `limit.go`: This file, located in the `actor` package, contains code related to rate limiting and concurrency control for the Cody Gateway. It defines a `RateLimit` struct with fields like `AllowedModels`, `Limit`, `Interval`, `ConcurrentRequests`, and `ConcurrentRequestsInterval`. It also includes functions for evaluating allowed models, handling concurrency limits, and updating actors (users or clients) based on access errors.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. `README.md`: This file provides a brief description of the `@sourcegraph/cody-agent` package, which implements a JSON-RPC server for interacting with Cody via stdout/stdin, intended for non-ECMAScript clients like JetBrains and NeoVim plugins.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Overall, the provided code seems to be part of the Sourcegraph Cody project, which is an AI coding assistant. The code includes components for code intelligence, rate limiting, concurrency control, and client communication.
