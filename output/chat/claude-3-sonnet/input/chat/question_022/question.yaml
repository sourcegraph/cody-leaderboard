# CHAT_QUESTION what does @limit.go do?

# CHAT_REPLY The `limit.go` file in the provided codebase context contains functions related to limiting the number of file matches, line matches, and chunk matches returned from a search operation. Here's a breakdown of what the file does:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. `SortAndTruncateFiles` is a convenience function that sorts the given `FileMatch` slice and then truncates it based on the provided `SearchOptions`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. `DisplayTruncator` is a type that represents a stateful function used to enforce limits on the number of documents (files) and matches displayed. It takes a slice of `FileMatch` and returns a potentially truncated slice along with a boolean indicating if there are more matches beyond the limit.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. `NewDisplayTruncator` creates a new `DisplayTruncator` based on the provided `SearchOptions`. It checks if there are any limits set for the maximum number of documents and matches to display. If there are no limits, it returns a no-op `DisplayTruncator`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. `limitMatches` is an internal function that applies the appropriate limit (either `limitChunkMatches` or `limitLineMatches`) to each `FileMatch` in the given slice, stopping when the limit is reached.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. `limitChunkMatches` limits the number of `ChunkMatches` in a `FileMatch`. It truncates the `Ranges`, `SymbolInfo`, and `Content` fields of each `ChunkMatch` to fit within the specified limit.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 6. `limitLineMatches` limits the number of `LineMatches` in a `FileMatch` by truncating the `LineFragments` slice of each `LineMatch` to fit within the specified limit.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY In summary, the `limit.go` file provides functionality to limit the number of file matches, line matches, and chunk matches returned from a search operation based on configurable limits specified in the `SearchOptions`. This is likely used to prevent returning an excessive amount of data for large search results.
