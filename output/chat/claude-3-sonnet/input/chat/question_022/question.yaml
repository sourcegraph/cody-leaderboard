# CHAT_QUESTION what does @limit.go do?

# CHAT_REPLY The `limit.go` file provides functionality to limit the number of file matches and line/chunk matches returned from a search operation. It defines two main types: `DisplayTruncator` and `NewDisplayTruncator`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY `DisplayTruncator` is a stateful function that enforces document and match display limits by truncating the results before returning them. It takes a slice of `FileMatch` as input and returns a truncated slice of `FileMatch` and a boolean indicating if there are more matches to be displayed.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY `NewDisplayTruncator` creates a new `DisplayTruncator` based on the provided `SearchOptions`. It takes into account the `MaxDocDisplayCount` and `MaxMatchDisplayCount` options to determine if any limits need to be enforced. If no limits are set, it returns a `DisplayTruncator` that simply passes through the input without any truncation.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The file also provides helper functions `limitChunkMatches` and `limitLineMatches` to limit the number of chunk matches and line matches, respectively, within each `FileMatch`. These functions are used by the `DisplayTruncator` to enforce the match display limits.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY In summary, `limit.go` provides a way to limit the number of search results returned to the user based on configurable options, ensuring that the output remains manageable and within the specified limits.
