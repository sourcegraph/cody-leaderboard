# CHAT_QUESTION what does @limit.go do?

# CHAT_REPLY Absolutely! The `limit.go` file contains functions that handle limiting the number of displayed matches and files in search results. Here's a breakdown of its main functionality:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. `SortAndTruncateFiles` sorts the list of `FileMatch` structs and then truncates them based on the specified `SearchOptions`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. `DisplayTruncator` is a function type that takes a slice of `FileMatch` structs and returns a truncated slice along with a boolean indicating if there are more matches to display.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. `NewDisplayTruncator` creates a `DisplayTruncator` function based on the `SearchOptions`. It enforces limits on the maximum number of displayed documents (`MaxDocDisplayCount`) and matches (`MaxMatchDisplayCount`).
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. `limitMatches` is a helper function that limits the number of matches in each `FileMatch` struct based on the specified limit and whether to chunk matches or not.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. `limitChunkMatches` truncates the `ChunkMatches` field of a `FileMatch` struct to the specified limit. It handles multiline ranges and context lines correctly.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 6. `limitLineMatches` truncates the `LineMatches` field of a `FileMatch` struct to the specified limit.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY In summary, this file provides functionality to limit the number of displayed search results, ensuring that the output doesn't exceed specified limits and remains manageable for the user.
