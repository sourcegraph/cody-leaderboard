# CHAT_QUESTION what does @limit.go do?

# CHAT_REPLY The `limit.go` file in the provided codebase context contains functions related to limiting and truncating the search results based on the specified options. Here's a breakdown of what the file does:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. `SortAndTruncateFiles` is a convenience function that sorts the `FileMatch` slice and then truncates it based on the `SearchOptions` provided.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. `DisplayTruncator` is a type alias for a function that takes a slice of `FileMatch` and returns a potentially truncated slice of `FileMatch` along with a boolean indicating if there are more results to be displayed.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. `NewDisplayTruncator` is a function that returns a `DisplayTruncator` based on the `SearchOptions`. It checks if there are any limits set for the maximum number of documents (`MaxDocDisplayCount`) or matches (`MaxMatchDisplayCount`) to be displayed. If there are no limits, it returns a `DisplayTruncator` that doesn't perform any truncation.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. `limitMatches` is a helper function that limits the number of matches in each `FileMatch` based on the specified limit and whether to chunk matches or not.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. `limitChunkMatches` is a function that limits the number of `ChunkMatches` in a `FileMatch`. It does this by truncating the `Ranges`, `SymbolInfo`, and `Content` fields of each `ChunkMatch` to the specified limit.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 6. `limitLineMatches` is a function that limits the number of `LineMatches` in a `FileMatch`. It does this by truncating the `LineFragments` field of each `LineMatch` to the specified limit.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY In summary, the `limit.go` file provides functionality to limit and truncate search results based on user-specified options, such as the maximum number of documents or matches to display. This is likely used to prevent overwhelming the user with too many results and to improve performance by limiting the amount of data that needs to be processed and returned.
