# CHAT_QUESTION what does @limit.go do?

# CHAT_REPLY The `limit.go` file in the provided codebase context contains functions related to limiting and truncating the search results based on the specified options. Here's a summary of what the file does:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. `SortAndTruncateFiles` is a convenience function that sorts the `FileMatch` slice and then truncates it based on the `SearchOptions`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. `DisplayTruncator` is a type that represents a stateful function used to enforce document and match display limits by truncating and mutating the `FileMatch` slice.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. `NewDisplayTruncator` creates a new `DisplayTruncator` based on the `SearchOptions`. It checks if there are any limits to enforce (`MaxDocDisplayCount` and `MaxMatchDisplayCount`). If there are no limits, it returns a no-op function.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. `limitMatches` is a helper function that iterates over the `FileMatch` slice and applies either `limitChunkMatches` or `limitLineMatches` based on the `ChunkMatches` option.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. `limitChunkMatches` limits the number of `ChunkMatches` in a `FileMatch`. It truncates the `Ranges`, `SymbolInfo`, and `Content` fields of each `ChunkMatch` based on the specified limit.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 6. `limitLineMatches` limits the number of `LineMatches` in a `FileMatch`. It truncates the `LineFragments` field of each `LineMatch` based on the specified limit.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY In summary, this file provides functionality to limit and truncate search results based on the specified options, such as the maximum number of documents to display and the maximum number of matches to display. It does this by sorting the results and then applying truncation logic to the `FileMatch` slice.
