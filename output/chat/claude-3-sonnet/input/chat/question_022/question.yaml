# CHAT_QUESTION what does @limit.go do?

# CHAT_REPLY The `limit.go` file in the provided codebase context contains functions related to limiting the number of file matches, chunk matches, and line matches returned by a search operation. Here's a breakdown of what the file does:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. `SortAndTruncateFiles` is a convenience function that sorts the given `FileMatch` slice and then truncates it based on the provided `SearchOptions`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. `DisplayTruncator` is a type alias for a function that takes a slice of `FileMatch` and returns a potentially truncated slice of `FileMatch` along with a boolean indicating whether there are more matches to be displayed.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. `NewDisplayTruncator` creates a `DisplayTruncator` function based on the provided `SearchOptions`. It enforces limits on the maximum number of documents (`MaxDocDisplayCount`) and the maximum number of matches (`MaxMatchDisplayCount`) to be displayed.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. `limitMatches` is a helper function that limits the number of chunk matches or line matches in each `FileMatch` based on the provided `limit` and the `chunkMatches` flag.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. `limitChunkMatches` is a function that limits the number of chunk matches in a `FileMatch`. It truncates the `Ranges`, `SymbolInfo`, and `Content` fields of each `ChunkMatch` to fit within the provided `limit`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 6. `limitLineMatches` is a function that limits the number of line matches in a `FileMatch`. It truncates the `LineFragments` field of each `LineMatch` to fit within the provided `limit`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY In summary, the `limit.go` file provides functionality to limit the number of file matches, chunk matches, and line matches returned by a search operation based on configurable limits. This is likely done to control the amount of data returned and improve performance for large search results.
