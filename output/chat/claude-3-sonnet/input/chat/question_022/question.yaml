# CHAT_QUESTION what does @limit.go do?

# CHAT_REPLY The `limit.go` file in the provided codebase context contains functions that handle limiting and truncating the search results based on the specified options. Here's a high-level overview of what it does:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. `SortAndTruncateFiles` is a convenience function that sorts the list of `FileMatch` results and then truncates them based on the provided `SearchOptions`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. `DisplayTruncator` is a type that represents a stateful function responsible for enforcing document and match display limits by truncating the results.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. `NewDisplayTruncator` creates a new `DisplayTruncator` based on the provided `SearchOptions`. It checks if there are any limits to enforce (e.g., `MaxDocDisplayCount` or `MaxMatchDisplayCount`). If there are no limits, it returns a no-op function.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. The `limitMatches` function applies the appropriate limit (either `limitChunkMatches` or `limitLineMatches`) to each `FileMatch` in the list, based on the specified `chunkMatches` option.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. `limitChunkMatches` limits the number of `ChunkMatches` in a `FileMatch`. It truncates the `Ranges`, `SymbolInfo`, and `Content` fields of each `ChunkMatch` based on the specified limit.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 6. `limitLineMatches` limits the number of `LineMatches` in a `FileMatch` by truncating the `LineFragments` field of each `LineMatch` based on the specified limit.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY In summary, the `limit.go` file provides functionality to enforce limits on the number of documents and matches displayed in search results, ensuring that the output remains manageable and within the specified constraints.
