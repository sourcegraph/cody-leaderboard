# CHAT_QUESTION Can you look through the files and identify the conflicting packages that may be causing this?

# CHAT_REPLY There don't appear to be any conflicting packages in the provided code context. The files show:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. `README.md` - This is a markdown file providing an overview and instructions for the Zoekt project. It does not contain any Go code or package declarations.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. `limit.go` - This is a Go source file that is part of the `zoekt` package. It contains functions related to limiting and truncating search results based on specified options. There are no conflicting packages within this file.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The provided context does not include enough information to identify conflicting packages. Typically, package conflicts would arise if there are multiple packages with the same name imported from different locations, or if there are cyclic import dependencies between packages. To identify such issues, I would need to see the entire codebase structure, import statements, and any build errors or conflicts reported by the Go compiler or tooling.
