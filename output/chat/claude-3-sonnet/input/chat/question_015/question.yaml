# CHAT_QUESTION Can you look through the files and identify the conflicting packages that may be causing this?

# CHAT_REPLY Unfortunately, there is no information provided about conflicting packages or any specific issue you are facing. The provided code files seem to be related to search result truncation and limiting in the Zoekt search engine. Without more context about the problem you are encountering, I cannot identify any conflicting packages. However, I'd be happy to take a closer look if you can provide more details about the issue you are experiencing.

 class: debug code
 files:
   - ../mocked/codebase_context/README.md
   - ../mocked/codebase_context/limit.go
