# CHAT_QUESTION Can you look through the files and identify the conflicting packages that may be causing this?

# CHAT_REPLY Unfortunately, the provided code files do not contain any information about conflicting packages or errors related to package conflicts. The files seem to be focused on implementing functionality for sorting, truncating, and limiting search results based on various options and limits. Without additional context or error messages, I cannot identify any conflicting packages from the given code.

 class: debug code
 files:
   - ../mocked/codebase_context/README.md
   - ../mocked/codebase_context/limit.go
