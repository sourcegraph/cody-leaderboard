# CHAT_QUESTION Can you look through the files and identify the conflicting packages that may be causing this?

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided codebase context, there does not appear to be any conflicting packages mentioned. The files provided are:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. `README.md`: This is a documentation file that provides an overview of the Zoekt project, including instructions for downloading, indexing, and searching.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. `limit.go`: This is a Go source file that contains functions related to limiting the number of search results displayed, such as `SortAndTruncateFiles`, `NewDisplayTruncator`, `limitChunkMatches`, and `limitLineMatches`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Both files are part of the `zoekt` package, and there are no other packages mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot identify any conflicting packages based on the given information.

 files:
   - ../mocked/codebase_context/README.md
   - ../mocked/codebase_context/limit.go
