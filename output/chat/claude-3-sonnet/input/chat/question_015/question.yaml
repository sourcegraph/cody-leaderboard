# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the Zoekt project, including instructions for downloading, indexing, and searching. It does not contain any code or package information.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. `limit.go`: This file contains Go code related to limiting and truncating search results based on various options, such as maximum document and match display counts. It is part of the `zoekt` package.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The provided files do not mention or reference any conflicting packages. Without more context or information about the specific issue you are facing, it is not possible to identify conflicting packages from the given codebase context.
