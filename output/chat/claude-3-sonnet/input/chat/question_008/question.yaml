# CHAT_QUESTION What does this repo do??

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided code snippet, this repository appears to be part of a project called "zoekt". The code deals with limiting and truncating the results of a search operation.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The `SortAndTruncateFiles` function sorts and truncates a slice of `FileMatch` structs based on the provided `SearchOptions`. It uses the `SortFiles` function (not shown) to sort the files, and then creates a `DisplayTruncator` using `NewDisplayTruncator`. The `DisplayTruncator` is a function that enforces limits on the number of documents and matches displayed, by truncating the input slice of `FileMatch` structs.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The `NewDisplayTruncator` function creates a `DisplayTruncator` based on the `SearchOptions`. It checks if there are limits on the maximum number of documents (`MaxDocDisplayCount`) and matches (`MaxMatchDisplayCount`) to display. If there are no limits, it returns a no-op `DisplayTruncator`. Otherwise, it returns a `DisplayTruncator` that enforces the specified limits.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The `limitMatches` function is a helper function that applies the `limitChunkMatches` or `limitLineMatches` function to each `FileMatch` in the input slice, depending on the `ChunkMatches` flag in the `SearchOptions`. These functions limit the number of `ChunkMatches` or `LineMatches` in each `FileMatch` to the specified limit.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Overall, this code seems to be part of a search engine or a code search tool, where it is responsible for limiting and truncating the search results based on user-specified options, to prevent displaying too many matches or files.
