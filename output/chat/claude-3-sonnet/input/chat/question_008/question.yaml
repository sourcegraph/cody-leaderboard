# CHAT_QUESTION What does this repo do??

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided code snippet, this repository appears to be related to a search engine or a tool for searching and displaying code or text files. The code deals with sorting, truncating, and limiting the number of file matches and line/chunk matches returned from a search operation.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Here are some key observations:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. The package name is `zoekt`, which could be a reference to a search engine or tool.
# CHAT_REPLY 2. The `SortAndTruncateFiles` function sorts and truncates a slice of `FileMatch` structs based on the provided `SearchOptions`.
# CHAT_REPLY 3. The `DisplayTruncator` type is a function that enforces limits on the number of documents (files) and matches displayed, by truncating the input slice of `FileMatch` structs.
# CHAT_REPLY 4. The `NewDisplayTruncator` function creates a `DisplayTruncator` based on the provided `SearchOptions`, which can include limits on the maximum number of documents and matches to display.
# CHAT_REPLY 5. The `limitMatches` function limits the number of `ChunkMatches` or `LineMatches` in each `FileMatch` struct, based on the provided limits and whether matches should be chunked or not.
# CHAT_REPLY 6. The `limitChunkMatches` and `limitLineMatches` functions are responsible for truncating the `ChunkMatches` and `LineMatches` slices, respectively, within each `FileMatch` struct.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY While the code doesn't provide a complete picture of the repository's purpose, it strongly suggests that it is related to a search engine or tool that searches through code or text files, and provides mechanisms for sorting, truncating, and limiting the search results based on various options and constraints.
