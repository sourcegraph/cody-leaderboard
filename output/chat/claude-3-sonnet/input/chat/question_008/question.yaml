# CHAT_QUESTION What does this repo do??

# CHAT_REPLY This repository contains code for a search engine called Zoekt. It provides functionality for searching and indexing code repositories, with features like limiting the number of displayed matches and sorting the search results.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The key components include:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **SortAndTruncateFiles**: This function sorts the search results (FileMatch objects) and then truncates them based on the specified search options (SearchOptions).
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **DisplayTruncator**: This is a stateful function that enforces limits on the number of displayed documents (files) and matches by truncating the results before returning them.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. **NewDisplayTruncator**: This function creates a new DisplayTruncator based on the provided SearchOptions, which can include limits on the maximum number of displayed documents and matches.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. **limitMatches**: This function limits the number of matches (either chunk matches or line matches) in each FileMatch object based on the specified limit.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. **limitChunkMatches** and **limitLineMatches**: These functions handle the truncation of chunk matches and line matches, respectively, within each FileMatch object.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The code provides a way to control the amount of search results displayed to the user, which can be useful for large codebases or when the number of matches is overwhelming. It allows for a more manageable and focused presentation of search results.
