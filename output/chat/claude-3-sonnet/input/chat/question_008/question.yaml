# CHAT_QUESTION What does this repo do??

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided code snippet, this repository appears to be part of a project called "zoekt". The code deals with sorting and truncating search results, specifically file matches and line/chunk matches within those files.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The main functions and types are:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. `SortAndTruncateFiles`: This function sorts the given `FileMatch` slice and then truncates it based on the provided `SearchOptions`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. `DisplayTruncator`: This is a type alias for a function that takes a slice of `FileMatch` and returns a (potentially truncated) slice of `FileMatch` along with a boolean indicating if there are more matches to be displayed.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. `NewDisplayTruncator`: This function returns a `DisplayTruncator` that enforces the limits specified in the `SearchOptions` (e.g., `MaxDocDisplayCount` and `MaxMatchDisplayCount`).
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. `limitMatches`: This function limits the number of chunk or line matches in the given `FileMatch` slice based on the provided limit and whether to chunk matches or not.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. `limitChunkMatches`: This function limits the number of chunk matches in a single `FileMatch` by truncating the `Ranges`, `SymbolInfo`, and `Content` fields as necessary.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 6. `limitLineMatches`: This function limits the number of line matches in a single `FileMatch` by truncating the `LineFragments` field.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Overall, this code seems to be part of a search engine or a code search tool that retrieves file matches and provides functionality to sort and limit the number of displayed matches based on user-specified options.
