# CHAT_QUESTION What does this repo do??

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the code provided, this appears to be part of a repository called "zoekt" which likely provides functionality for searching and matching code or text files.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The `SortAndTruncateFiles` function sorts a slice of `FileMatch` structs and then truncates the results based on the provided `SearchOptions`. This suggests that the code is used to perform searches and return matching files, with the ability to limit the number of results displayed.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The `DisplayTruncator` type and `NewDisplayTruncator` function are responsible for creating a function that can truncate the search results based on the specified limits in the `SearchOptions`. The `limitMatches` function is used to limit the number of matches within each `FileMatch` struct, either by limiting the number of `ChunkMatches` or `LineMatches` depending on the `chunkMatches` option.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Overall, this code seems to be part of a larger system for searching and matching files, with the ability to control the display of results by setting limits on the number of files, chunks, or line matches shown.
