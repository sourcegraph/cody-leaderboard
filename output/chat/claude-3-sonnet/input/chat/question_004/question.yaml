# CHAT_QUESTION how do slices work in go?

# CHAT_REPLY In Go, slices are a built-in data type that provides a flexible and efficient way to work with sequences of elements. They are essentially a reference to an underlying array, allowing you to access and manipulate a subset of the array's elements without copying the entire array.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Here are some key points about slices in Go:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **Slice Creation**: You can create a slice using the built-in `make` function or by slicing an array or another slice. For example:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY ```go
# CHAT_REPLY // Creating a slice with make
# CHAT_REPLY slice1 := make([]int, 3, 5) // len=3, cap=5
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY // Slicing an array
# CHAT_REPLY arr := [5]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
# CHAT_REPLY slice2 := arr[1:4] // slice2 = [2, 3, 4]
# CHAT_REPLY ```
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **Length and Capacity**: A slice has both a length and a capacity. The length is the number of elements it contains, and the capacity is the maximum number of elements it can hold before resizing is required.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. **Appending Elements**: You can append elements to a slice using the built-in `append` function. If the slice doesn't have enough capacity, a new underlying array is allocated with a larger capacity.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY ```go
# CHAT_REPLY slice := []int{1, 2, 3}
# CHAT_REPLY slice = append(slice, 4, 5) // slice = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# CHAT_REPLY ```
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. **Slicing Operations**: You can create new slices by slicing existing slices or arrays. This operation doesn't copy the underlying array; it creates a new slice that references the same underlying array.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY ```go
# CHAT_REPLY slice := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
# CHAT_REPLY subSlice := slice[1:3] // subSlice = [2, 3]
# CHAT_REPLY ```
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. **Modifying Elements**: Since slices are references to the underlying array, modifying the elements of a slice also modifies the corresponding elements in the original array.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 6. **Built-in Functions**: Go provides several built-in functions for working with slices, such as `len` (to get the length), `cap` (to get the capacity), `copy` (to copy elements from one slice to another), and more.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 7. **Slice Tricks**: Go slices have some handy tricks, like omitting the low or high bounds to slice from the start or to the end of the underlying array, respectively.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY ```go
# CHAT_REPLY slice := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
# CHAT_REPLY subSlice1 := slice[2:] // subSlice1 = [3, 4, 5]
# CHAT_REPLY subSlice2 := slice[:3] // subSlice2 = [1, 2, 3]
# CHAT_REPLY ```
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY In the provided code snippet, the `slices.Contains` function is likely a custom function from a third-party package or a custom utility function. It is used to check if a slice contains a specific value. The standard library doesn't provide a built-in function for this purpose, but you can easily implement it yourself or use a third-party package like `github.com/golang/go/src/pkg/sort/slice.go`.
