# CHAT_QUESTION what is squirrel?

# CHAT_REPLY Squirrel is a code intelligence API that provides functionality to retrieve symbol information from a given file. It is an interface that defines a single method `symbolInformation` which takes a file path as input and returns an object of type `CodeIntelligence` containing an array of symbols present in that file.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The `CodeIntelligence` interface is a simple data structure that holds an array of strings representing the symbols found in the file. This could include things like variable names, function names, class names, etc.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To use the Squirrel API, you would likely create an instance of an object that implements the `Squirrel` interface, and then call the `symbolInformation` method with the desired file path. The returned `CodeIntelligence` object can then be used to access the list of symbols for that file.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY This API could be useful in various scenarios, such as code editors, IDEs, or other tools that need to provide code intelligence features like auto-completion, go-to-definition, find-all-references, and more. By analyzing the symbols in a file, these tools can provide a better developer experience by offering context-aware assistance and navigation capabilities.
