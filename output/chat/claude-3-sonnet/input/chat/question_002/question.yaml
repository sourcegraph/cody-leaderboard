# CHAT_QUESTION what is squirrel?

# CHAT_REPLY According to the provided code context, Squirrel is an interface that represents a code intelligence API. It has a single method called `symbolInformation` that takes a `file` string as input and returns an object of type `CodeIntelligence`, which contains an array of strings called `symbols`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The comment above the `Squirrel` interface states that "Squirrel is a code intelligence API", which suggests that it is likely a tool or library used for analyzing code and extracting information about symbols (variables, functions, classes, etc.) within that code.
