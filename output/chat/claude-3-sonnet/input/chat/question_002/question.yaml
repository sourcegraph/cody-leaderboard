# CHAT_QUESTION what is squirrel?

# CHAT_REPLY According to the provided code context, `Squirrel` is an interface that represents a code intelligence API. It has a single method `symbolInformation` that takes a `file` string as input and returns an object of type `CodeIntelligence`, which contains an array of `symbols` (strings).
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY So, `Squirrel` is likely an API or service that provides information about symbols (variables, functions, classes, etc.) present in a given file. This could be useful for code editors, IDEs, or other tools that need to provide code intelligence features like auto-completion, go-to-definition, find-references, and so on.
