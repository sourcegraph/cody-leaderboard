# CHAT_QUESTION implement a dog class

# CHAT_REPLY Sure, here's an implementation of a Dog class that extends the Animal interface:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY ```typescript
# CHAT_REPLY class Dog implements Animal {
# CHAT_REPLY   name: string;
# CHAT_REPLY   age: number;
# CHAT_REPLY   breed: string;
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY   constructor(name: string, age: number, breed: string) {
# CHAT_REPLY     this.name = name;
# CHAT_REPLY     this.age = age;
# CHAT_REPLY     this.breed = breed;
# CHAT_REPLY   }
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY   bark() {
# CHAT_REPLY     console.log(`${this.name} says: Woof!`);
# CHAT_REPLY   }
# CHAT_REPLY }
# CHAT_REPLY ```
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY This Dog class has three properties: `name` and `age` inherited from the Animal interface, and an additional `breed` property specific to dogs. The constructor takes in values for all three properties.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Additionally, the Dog class has a `bark` method that logs a message to the console with the dog's name and a barking sound.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY You can create instances of the Dog class like this:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY ```typescript
# CHAT_REPLY const fido = new Dog('Fido', 3, 'Labrador');
# CHAT_REPLY fido.bark(); // Output: Fido says: Woof!
# CHAT_REPLY ```
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY This implementation allows you to create Dog objects with specific names, ages, and breeds, and also provides a way for the dogs to bark. You can extend this class further by adding more dog-specific methods or properties as needed.
