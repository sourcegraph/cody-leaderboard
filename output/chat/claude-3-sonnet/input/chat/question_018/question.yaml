# CHAT_QUESTION See zoekt repo find location of tensor function

# CHAT_REPLY Unfortunately, I could not find any references to a "tensor" function in the provided codebase context. The codebase appears to be for a text search engine called "Zoekt" and does not seem to contain any code related to tensors or machine learning.

 files:
   - ../mocked/codebase_context/README.md
   - ../mocked/codebase_context/limit.go
   - ../mocked/codebase_context/eval.go
