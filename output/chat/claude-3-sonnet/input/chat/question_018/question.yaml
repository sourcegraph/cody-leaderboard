 question: See zoekt repo find location of tensor function

# CHAT_QUESTION See zoekt repo find location of tensor function

# CHAT_REPLY Unfortunately, I could not find any references to a "tensor" function in the provided codebase context for the Zoekt repository. The codebase appears to be focused on implementing a fast text search engine for source code, and does not seem to contain any functionality related to tensors or tensor operations.

 files:
   - ../mocked/codebase_context/README.md
   - ../mocked/codebase_context/limit.go
   - ../mocked/codebase_context/eval.go
