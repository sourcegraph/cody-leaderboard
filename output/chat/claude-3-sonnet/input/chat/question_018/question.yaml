# CHAT_QUESTION See zoekt repo find location of tensor function

# CHAT_REPLY Certainly! Based on the provided codebase context, the Zoekt repository does not appear to contain any functions or code related to tensors or tensor operations. Zoekt is a fast text search engine intended for use with source code. It provides functionality for indexing and searching through code repositories, but it does not seem to have any specific tensor-related functionality. The codebase primarily deals with parsing queries, building search indexes, evaluating match trees, and returning search results for code files and repositories.
