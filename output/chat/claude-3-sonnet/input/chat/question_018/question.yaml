# CHAT_QUESTION See zoekt repo find location of tensor function

# CHAT_REPLY Certainly! Based on the provided codebase context, the Zoekt repository does not appear to contain any functions related to tensors or tensor operations. Zoekt is a fast text search engine intended for use with source code. It does not seem to have any functionality specific to tensors or machine learning.
