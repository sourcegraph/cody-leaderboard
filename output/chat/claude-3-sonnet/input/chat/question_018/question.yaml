# CHAT_QUESTION See zoekt repo find location of tensor function

# CHAT_REPLY Sure, I can help you find the location of the tensor function in the Zoekt repository. Based on the codebase context provided, Zoekt is a fast text search engine intended for use with source code. It does not appear to have any functionality related to tensors or machine learning operations.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY However, if you are looking for a tensor function in a different codebase or project, I can assist you in locating it. Please provide more context about the specific codebase or project you are referring to, and I will guide you through the process of finding the tensor function within that codebase.
