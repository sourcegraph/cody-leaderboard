# CHAT_QUESTION What code do you have access to?

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided README file, I have access to the source code for Zoekt, which is a fast text search engine intended for use with source code. The README provides instructions for downloading, indexing, and searching the codebase using various commands like `zoekt-index`, `zoekt-git-index`, `zoekt-webserver`, and `zoekt`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The README also mentions that this is a fork of the original Google Zoekt repository (https://github.com/google/zoekt) by Sourcegraph (https://github.com/sourcegraph/zoekt). It outlines some of the differences between this fork and the original, such as the addition of a `zoekt-sourcegraph-indexserver` command, exposing the API via `keegancsmith/rpc`, support for searching across branches/repos, and returning symbol/ctag data in results.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY However, the actual source code files are not provided in the context. The README only gives an overview of the project and instructions for using the various components.
