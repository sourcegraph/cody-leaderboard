# CHAT_QUESTION What code do you have access to?

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the codebase context provided, I have access to the source code for Zoekt, which is a fast text search engine intended for use with source code. Zoekt is a fork of the original Google project, and this particular fork is maintained by Sourcegraph. The codebase includes various commands and utilities for indexing code repositories (e.g., zoekt-index, zoekt-git-index, zoekt-repo-index), running the Zoekt web server (zoekt-webserver), performing searches via the JSON API or CLI, and managing the search service (zoekt-indexserver). The codebase also includes functionality for symbol search using ctags data. Overall, it provides a comprehensive set of tools for efficiently indexing and searching large codebases.
