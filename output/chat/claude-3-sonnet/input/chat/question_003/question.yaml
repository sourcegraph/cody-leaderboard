# CHAT_QUESTION What code do you have access to?

# CHAT_REPLY Certainly! Based on the provided codebase context, I have access to the source code of Zoekt, which is a fast text search engine intended for use with source code. Specifically, I can see the code for various components and commands related to Zoekt, such as zoekt-index, zoekt-git-index, zoekt-repo-index, zoekt-mirror-gitiles, zoekt-webserver, and zoekt (the CLI tool). Additionally, I can see the code for zoekt-indexserver, which is a service management program for Zoekt, and zoekt-sourcegraph-indexserver, which is a Sourcegraph-specific command for indexing all enabled repositories on Sourcegraph.
