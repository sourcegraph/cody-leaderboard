# CHAT_QUESTION What code do you have access to?

# CHAT_REPLY I have access to the code for Zoekt, which is a fast text search engine intended for use with source code. Zoekt is a fork of the original Google project, and is now the main maintained source hosted on the Sourcegraph GitHub repository.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The codebase includes various commands and utilities for indexing directories, Git repositories, and repositories hosted on repo hosting services like GitHub and Google Source. It also includes a web server for serving search results via a web interface or JSON API, as well as a command-line interface for searching indexed code.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Some key components are:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY - `zoekt-index` for indexing directories
# CHAT_REPLY - `zoekt-git-index` for indexing Git repositories
# CHAT_REPLY - `zoekt-repo-index` for indexing repositories from repo hosting services
# CHAT_REPLY - `zoekt-webserver` for serving the web interface and JSON API
# CHAT_REPLY - `zoekt` for the command-line search interface
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The codebase also includes functionality for symbol/ctag indexing and searching, efficient repository filtering, API exposure, and other enhancements specific to the Sourcegraph fork.
