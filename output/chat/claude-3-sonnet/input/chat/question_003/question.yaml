# CHAT_QUESTION What code do you have access to?

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided codebase context, I have access to the code for the Zoekt project, which is a fast text search engine intended for use with source code. The README file provides instructions for downloading, indexing, and searching the codebase using various commands like `zoekt-index`, `zoekt-git-index`, `zoekt-webserver`, and `zoekt`.
