# CHAT_QUESTION What code do you have access to?

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided README file, I have access to the source code for Zoekt, which is a fast text search engine intended for use with source code. The README provides instructions for downloading, indexing, and searching the codebase using various commands like `zoekt-index`, `zoekt-git-index`, `zoekt-webserver`, and `zoekt`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The README also mentions that this is a fork of the original Zoekt repository from Google (https://github.com/google/zoekt) and is now the main maintained source hosted at https://github.com/sourcegraph/zoekt. However, the actual source code files are not provided in the context.
