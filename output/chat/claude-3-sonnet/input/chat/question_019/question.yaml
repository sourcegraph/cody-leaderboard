# CHAT_QUESTION Explain the logic in src/agent.go, particularly how agents interact with ranking

# CHAT_REPLY Unfortunately, the provided codebase context does not contain any source code files, including `src/agent.go`. The context is just a `README.md` file that provides an overview of Zoekt, a text search engine for source code. It does not go into details about the implementation logic or how agents interact with ranking.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Without access to the actual source code, I cannot provide an explanation of the logic in `src/agent.go` or how agents interact with ranking in Zoekt. The README file does not cover those implementation details.
