 question: Explain the logic in src/agent.go, particularly how agents interact with ranking

# CHAT_QUESTION Explain the logic in src/agent.go, particularly how agents interact with ranking

# CHAT_REPLY Unfortunately, there is no `src/agent.go` file provided in the codebase context. The context only contains a `README.md` file that gives an overview of Zoekt, a fast text search engine for source code. It does not include any source code files or details about how agents interact with ranking logic. Without access to the actual source code, I cannot provide an explanation of the logic in a specific file like `src/agent.go`.

 files:
   - ../mocked/codebase_context/README.md
