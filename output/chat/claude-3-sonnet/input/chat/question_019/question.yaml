# CHAT_QUESTION Explain the logic in src/agent.go, particularly how agents interact with ranking

# CHAT_REPLY Unfortunately, the provided codebase context does not contain the `src/agent.go` file or any details about how agents interact with ranking in Zoekt. The context is just a README file that provides an overview of Zoekt, instructions for downloading, indexing, searching, and some additional information about the fork details.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Without access to the actual source code files, I cannot provide an explanation of the logic in `src/agent.go` or how agents interact with ranking in Zoekt. The README does not cover those implementation details.
