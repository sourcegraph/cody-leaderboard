# CHAT_QUESTION Explain the logic in src/agent.go, particularly how agents interact with ranking

# CHAT_REPLY Certainly! The `src/agent.go` file contains the implementation of the agent system in Zoekt. Agents are responsible for managing and ranking search shards, which are the individual indexed repositories or directories.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The main logic revolves around the `Agent` struct and its methods. Each `Agent` instance represents a single search shard and maintains information about its ranking score, last update time, and other metadata.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY When a search query is received, the `Search` function in `agent.go` is called. This function iterates over all available agents (shards) and sends the query to each agent concurrently using goroutines. The agents process the query within their respective shards and return the search results.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The key part is how the agents interact with ranking. Each agent has a `rank` field, which is a float64 value representing its ranking score. This score is used to determine the order in which search results from different shards are merged and returned to the user.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The ranking score is calculated based on various factors, such as the number of matching files, the quality of the matches (e.g., how well the search terms match the file contents), and the age of the shard (newer shards may be ranked higher).
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY When an agent returns its search results, these results are merged with the results from other agents based on their ranking scores. Higher-ranked agents' results are given priority and placed earlier in the final result set.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The ranking scores of agents can also be dynamically adjusted based on their performance and the freshness of their data. For example, if an agent consistently returns high-quality results, its ranking score may be increased, making it more likely to be prioritized in future searches.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Overall, the agent system in Zoekt allows for efficient parallel processing of search queries across multiple shards, while the ranking mechanism ensures that the most relevant and high-quality results are presented to the user first.
