# CHAT_QUESTION Explain the logic in src/agent.go, particularly how agents interact with ranking

# CHAT_REPLY The `src/agent.go` file contains the implementation of the `Agent` struct, which is responsible for managing the search process and interacting with the ranking system. Here's an overview of the relevant logic:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **Agent Creation and Initialization**:
# CHAT_REPLY    - The `NewAgent` function creates a new `Agent` instance and initializes it with the provided configuration.
# CHAT_REPLY    - It sets up the necessary data structures, such as the `shards` map to store shard information and the `repoCache` to cache repository metadata.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **Search Execution**:
# CHAT_REPLY    - The `Search` method is the entry point for executing a search query.
# CHAT_REPLY    - It first parses the query using the `parseQuery` function.
# CHAT_REPLY    - It then calls the `searchShards` method, which is responsible for searching across the available shards.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. **Shard Search**:
# CHAT_REPLY    - The `searchShards` method iterates over the shards and performs the search on each shard concurrently using goroutines.
# CHAT_REPLY    - For each shard, it calls the `searchShard` method, which performs the actual search within the shard.
# CHAT_REPLY    - The search results from each shard are collected and merged into a single result set.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. **Ranking**:
# CHAT_REPLY    - After collecting the search results from all shards, the `Agent` interacts with the ranking system.
# CHAT_REPLY    - The `rank` method is called, which performs the ranking of the search results.
# CHAT_REPLY    - The ranking logic is implemented in the `ranking` package, which likely considers various factors such as file paths, line contents, and potentially other metadata to determine the relevance scores.
# CHAT_REPLY    - The ranked results are then returned to the caller.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. **Repository Cache**:
# CHAT_REPLY    - The `Agent` maintains a repository cache (`repoCache`) to store and retrieve repository metadata efficiently.
# CHAT_REPLY    - The `getRepoMetadata` method is used to fetch repository metadata from the cache or populate the cache if the metadata is not present.
# CHAT_REPLY    - This caching mechanism helps improve performance by avoiding redundant metadata lookups for repositories that have already been processed.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 6. **Shard Management**:
# CHAT_REPLY    - The `Agent` keeps track of the available shards and their metadata in the `shards` map.
# CHAT_REPLY    - The `addShard` method allows adding new shards to the `Agent`, which can be useful for dynamic shard management or incremental indexing scenarios.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY While the provided codebase context does not include the actual implementation details of the ranking algorithm, it is clear that the `Agent` acts as an orchestrator, coordinating the search process across multiple shards and interacting with the ranking system to produce the final ranked results.
