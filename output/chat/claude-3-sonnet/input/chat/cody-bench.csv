```typescript
class Dog implements Animal {

    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;

In this implementation, the `Dog` class has three properties: `name`, `age` (inherited from the `Animal` interface), and `breed` (specific to dogs). The constructor initializes these properties when creating a new `Dog` instance.

Additionally, the `Dog` class has a `bark` method that logs a barking sound to the console.

You can create instances of the `Dog` class like this:

```typescript
const buddy = new Dog(""Buddy"", 3, ""Golden Retriever"");
console.log(buddy.name); // Output: ""Buddy""
console.log(buddy.age); // Output: 3
console.log(buddy.breed); // Output: ""Golden Retriever""

Here's a high-level overview of how slices work:

1. **Slices are reference types**: Slices are not arrays themselves, but rather a reference to an underlying array. This means that when you create a slice, it doesn't copy the entire array, but instead, it creates a new reference to the same underlying array.

2. **Slices have a length and capacity**: A slice has a length, which represents the number of elements it contains, and a capacity, which represents the maximum number of elements it can hold before it needs to be reallocated.

3. **Slices can grow dynamically**: Unlike arrays, which have a fixed size, slices can grow dynamically using the built-in `append` function. When you append elements to a slice, Go automatically handles the reallocation of the underlying array if the capacity is exceeded.

4. **Slices can be sliced**: You can create new slices from existing slices using the slice operator (`slice[low:high]`). This operation creates a new slice that references the same underlying array as the original slice, but with a different length and capacity.

5. **Slices are efficient**: Because slices are references to underlying arrays, operations on slices are generally more efficient than operations on arrays, especially when it comes to passing them as arguments or returning them from functions.

6. **Slices support various operations**: Go provides a range of built-in functions and methods for working with slices, such as `append`, `copy`, `len`, `cap`, and more, making it easy to manipulate and work with slices in various ways.

Slices are widely used in Go programming, as they provide a flexible and efficient way to work with collections of data.

1. **Agent Pool Management**: The code maintains a pool of available agents, which can be acquired and released as needed for handling search requests. This allows for efficient resource utilization and concurrent processing of multiple searches.

2. **Search Execution**: When a search request is received, an available agent is acquired from the pool. The agent then performs the search across the relevant data shards, applying the specified query and filters.

3. **Result Ranking**: As the agent retrieves search results from the shards, it interacts with the ranking system to determine the relevance scores for each result. The ranking system likely considers factors such as file path, content similarity, and potentially other metadata or signals.

4. **Result Merging and Sorting**: After collecting results from all shards, the agent merges and sorts the results based on their relevance scores obtained from the ranking system. This ensures that the most relevant results are presented first.

5. **Result Pagination**: If the search results exceed a specified limit, the agent can handle pagination by returning only a subset of the top-ranked results for the requested page.

They are managed by the Go runtime and are multiplexed onto a pool of operating system threads. Here's how goroutines work:

1. **Creation**: Goroutines are created by the `go` keyword followed by a function call. When the `go` statement is executed, a new goroutine is created and added to the scheduler's run queue.

2. **Scheduling**: The Go scheduler is responsible for efficiently mapping goroutines onto the available operating system threads. It uses a technique called ""work-stealing"" to balance the load across threads. When a thread is idle, it can ""steal"" goroutines from other threads' run queues.

3. **Context Switching**: The Go scheduler periodically checks if any goroutines should be rescheduled or moved to a different thread. This is done using a lightweight context switching mechanism that is much more efficient than traditional thread context switching in operating systems.

4. **Synchronization**: Goroutines can communicate and synchronize using channels or other synchronization primitives like mutexes and wait groups. Channels are a built-in way of passing values between goroutines, allowing them to send and receive data safely without explicit locking.

5. **Memory Management**: Goroutines share the same address space, which means they can access and modify the same memory locations. However, Go employs a garbage collector to automatically manage memory, freeing developers from manual memory management.

6. **Goroutine Lifecycle**: Goroutines have a lifecycle similar to threads. They can be created, run, and terminate. When a goroutine completes its function execution, it terminates and its resources are reclaimed by the Go runtime.

The key advantages of goroutines are:

- **Lightweight**: Goroutines are much lighter than traditional threads, allowing applications to create thousands or even millions of goroutines with minimal overhead.
- **Efficient**: The Go scheduler and context switching mechanism are highly optimized, making goroutines efficient for concurrent programming.
- **Scalable**: Goroutines can be easily scaled across multiple CPU cores, taking advantage of modern hardware parallelism.
- **Simplicity**: Goroutines and channels provide a simple and expressive way to write concurrent code, reducing the complexity often associated with traditional thread programming.
