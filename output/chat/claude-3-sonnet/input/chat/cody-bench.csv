```typescript
class Dog implements Animal {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  breed: string;

  constructor(name: string, age: number, breed: string) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.breed = breed;
  }

  bark(): void {
    console.log(`${this.name} says: Woof!`);
  }
}
```

In this implementation, the `Dog` class has three properties: `name`, `age`, and `breed`. The `name` and `age` properties are inherited from the `Animal` interface, while the `breed` property is specific to the `Dog` class.

The constructor takes three parameters: `name`, `age`, and `breed`, and initializes the corresponding properties.

Additionally, we've added a `bark` method to the `Dog` class, which logs a message to the console with the dog's name and a barking sound.

You can create instances of the `Dog` class like this:

```typescript
const myDog = new Dog('Buddy', 3, 'Labrador');
console.log(myDog.name); // Output: 'Buddy'
console.log(myDog.age); // Output: 3
console.log(myDog.breed); // Output: 'Labrador'
myDog.bark(); // Output: 'Buddy says: Woof!'

They are essentially a reference to an underlying array, allowing you to access and manipulate a subset of the array's elements without copying the entire array.

Here are some key points about slices in Go:

1. **Slice Creation**: You can create a slice using the built-in `make` function or by slicing an array or another slice. For example:

```go
// Creating a slice with make
slice1 := make([]int, 3, 5) // len=3, cap=5

// Slicing an array
arr := [5]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
slice2 := arr[1:4] // slice2 = [2, 3, 4]
```

2. **Length and Capacity**: A slice has both a length and a capacity. The length is the number of elements it contains, and the capacity is the maximum number of elements it can hold before resizing is required.

3. **Appending Elements**: You can append elements to a slice using the built-in `append` function. If the slice doesn't have enough capacity, a new underlying array is allocated with a larger capacity.

```go
slice := []int{1, 2, 3}
slice = append(slice, 4, 5) // slice = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

4. **Slicing Operations**: You can create new slices by slicing existing slices or arrays. This operation doesn't copy the underlying array; it creates a new slice that references the same underlying array.

```go
slice := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
subSlice := slice[1:3] // subSlice = [2, 3]
```

5. **Modifying Elements**: Since slices are references to the underlying array, modifying the elements of a slice also modifies the corresponding elements in the original array.

6. **Built-in Functions**: Go provides several built-in functions for working with slices, such as `len` (to get the length), `cap` (to get the capacity), `copy` (to copy elements from one slice to another), and more.

7. **Slice Tricks**: Go slices have some handy tricks, like omitting the low or high bounds to slice from the start or to the end of the underlying array, respectively.

```go
slice := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
subSlice1 := slice[2:] // subSlice1 = [3, 4, 5]
subSlice2 := slice[:3] // subSlice2 = [1, 2, 3]
```

In the provided code snippet, the `slices.Contains` function is likely a custom function from a third-party package or a custom utility function. It is used to check if a slice contains a specific value. The standard library doesn't provide a built-in function for this purpose, but you can easily implement it yourself or use a third-party package like `github.com/golang/go/src/pkg/sort/slice.go`.",how do slices work in go?,,,2,,2,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1. `/n/` - This is the start of the regular expression pattern. The `/n/` part matches the literal string `""n""`.

2. `a|e|i|o|u` - This is an alternation (using the `|` operator) that matches any of the characters `'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, or `'u'`. It essentially matches any vowel.

3. `//n` - This part is invalid in most regex flavors. It appears to be attempting to match a literal forward slash `/` followed by the letter `'n'`. However, the double forward slashes `//` are typically used to start and end a regular expression pattern, not as part of the pattern itself.

So, while the provided regex is not valid, it seems to be attempting to match the pattern of a consonant `'n'` followed by a vowel (`'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, or `'u'`), and then another `'n'`. However, the double forward slashes at the end make the regex invalid.

We remove the default checkbox appearance using `appearance: none` and set the desired width, height, border, and border-radius. We also add a transition effect for the background color.

When the checkbox is checked (`:checked` pseudo-class), we set the background color to the light purple color using the `var(--light-purple)` variable. We also add a white checkmark icon as the background image using an SVG data URI.

2. **Download the latest Python version**: Visit the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of Python for your operating system.

3. **Install the new Python version**:
   - **Windows**: Run the downloaded installer and follow the prompts. You can choose to install Python for all users or just the current user.
   - **macOS**: The installer typically provides options to install the new version alongside the existing one or to uninstall the old version first.
   - **Linux**: The installation process varies depending on your distribution. You can use the package manager (e.g., `apt`, `yum`, `dnf`) to install the latest Python version or follow the instructions on the Python website for your specific distribution.

4. **Update your system's PATH variable** (Windows and some Linux distributions): After installing the new Python version, you may need to update your system's PATH variable to ensure that the new Python executable is found before the old one.

5. **Verify the installation**: Open a new terminal or command prompt and run `python --version` or `python3 --version` again to confirm that the new version is installed correctly.

It's generally recommended to keep both the old and new Python versions installed side-by-side, at least initially, to ensure that any existing scripts or applications that depend on the old version continue to work correctly.

go myFunction(arg1, arg2)
```

2. **Scheduling**: When a goroutine is created, it is added to a queue managed by the Go runtime. The Go scheduler, which is part of the runtime, is responsible for efficiently scheduling and running goroutines on the available logical CPUs.

3. **Context Switching**: The Go scheduler uses a technique called ""m:n scheduling"" to map goroutines (m) to operating system threads (n). This allows Go to efficiently multiplex goroutines onto a smaller number of OS threads, reducing the overhead of context switching between threads.

4. **Synchronization**: Goroutines can communicate and synchronize using channels, which are a built-in mechanism for safely passing data between goroutines. Channels prevent race conditions by enforcing that data is sent and received in a synchronized manner.

5. **Blocking Operations**: When a goroutine performs a blocking operation, such as an I/O operation or a channel send/receive, the Go scheduler automatically parks the goroutine and moves to another runnable goroutine. This allows other goroutines to continue executing while the blocked goroutine waits for its operation to complete.

6. **Garbage Collection**: Go's garbage collector is designed to work efficiently with goroutines. It can pause individual goroutines during garbage collection cycles, allowing other goroutines to continue running.

Goroutines are lightweight and efficient compared to traditional threads because they have a smaller memory footprint and lower overhead for creation, context switching, and synchronization. This makes it practical to create thousands or even millions of goroutines in a Go program, enabling highly concurrent and scalable applications.

However, it's important to note that while goroutines make it easy to achieve concurrency, they don't automatically prevent race conditions or other concurrency-related issues. Developers must still use proper synchronization mechanisms, such as channels or mutexes, to ensure thread safety and avoid data races.",how do goroutines work?,,,2,,2,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here's a breakdown of what the file does:

1. `SortAndTruncateFiles` is a convenience function that sorts the `FileMatch` slice and then truncates it based on the `SearchOptions` provided.

2. `DisplayTruncator` is a type alias for a function that takes a slice of `FileMatch` and returns a potentially truncated slice of `FileMatch` along with a boolean indicating if there are more results to be displayed.

3. `NewDisplayTruncator` is a function that returns a `DisplayTruncator` based on the `SearchOptions`. It checks if there are any limits set for the maximum number of documents (`MaxDocDisplayCount`) or matches (`MaxMatchDisplayCount`) to be displayed. If there are no limits, it returns a `DisplayTruncator` that doesn't perform any truncation.

4. `limitMatches` is a helper function that limits the number of matches in each `FileMatch` based on the specified limit and whether to chunk matches or not.

5. `limitChunkMatches` is a function that limits the number of `ChunkMatches` in a `FileMatch`. It does this by truncating the `Ranges`, `SymbolInfo`, and `Content` fields of each `ChunkMatch` to the specified limit.

6. `limitLineMatches` is a function that limits the number of `LineMatches` in a `FileMatch`. It does this by truncating the `LineFragments` field of each `LineMatch` to the specified limit.

In summary, the `limit.go` file provides functionality to limit and truncate search results based on user-specified options, such as the maximum number of documents or matches to display. This is likely used to prevent overwhelming the user with too many results and to improve performance by limiting the amount of data that needs to be processed and returned.",what does @limit.go do?,,,2,,2,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
