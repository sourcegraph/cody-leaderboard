# CHAT_QUESTION describe my code

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided codebase context, it appears that this repository contains the source code for Zoekt, a fast text search engine intended for use with source code. The codebase is written in Go and was originally created by Google, but is now maintained by Sourcegraph as a fork of the original Google repository.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The README.md file provides an overview of Zoekt, including instructions for downloading, indexing, and searching code repositories using Zoekt. It also mentions that Zoekt supports symbol search and can be integrated with a web interface or JSON API.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The eval.go file contains the core search functionality of Zoekt. It defines various data structures and functions for simplifying and evaluating search queries, gathering matches from indexed documents, scoring and ranking search results, and handling different types of queries (e.g., regular expressions, substring matches, branch filters).
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The limit.go file contains functions for sorting and truncating search results based on specified limits, such as the maximum number of documents or matches to display.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The provided context also includes a TypeScript file (src/external-services.ts) from a Visual Studio Code extension, but it's unclear how this file relates to the Zoekt codebase.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Overall, the provided context suggests that this codebase implements a powerful and efficient code search engine with advanced features like regular expression matching, symbol search, and result ranking and filtering.
