# CHAT_QUESTION describe my code

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided codebase context, it appears that you are working with the Zoekt code search engine, which is a fast text search engine intended for use with source code. The codebase contains various components and functionality related to indexing and searching code repositories.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The `README.md` file provides an overview of Zoekt, including instructions for downloading, indexing, and searching. It covers indexing directories, Git repositories, and repo repositories, as well as searching via the web interface, JSON API, and CLI.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The `eval.go` file contains the core functionality for searching and evaluating queries. It includes functions for simplifying queries, setting default search options, performing the actual search, gathering matches, and handling various query types (e.g., repo, language, regexp).
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The `limit.go` file contains functions for sorting, truncating, and limiting the search results based on specified options, such as maximum document and match display counts. It includes functions like `SortAndTruncateFiles`, `NewDisplayTruncator`, `limitMatches`, `limitChunkMatches`, and `limitLineMatches`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The provided TypeScript file (`vscode/src/external-services.ts`) seems to be part of a Visual Studio Code extension or integration with Zoekt, but without more context, it's difficult to determine its specific purpose.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Overall, the codebase appears to be focused on providing efficient code search capabilities, with features for indexing repositories, handling various query types, and managing search results.
