# CHAT_QUESTION Are you capable of upgrading my pytorch version to 1.0.0, there is a guide in the pytorch site

# CHAT_REPLY Unfortunately, the provided codebase context does not seem to be related to PyTorch or Python at all. The context appears to be for a Go project called Zoekt, which is a text search engine intended for source code.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Since there is no Python or PyTorch code in the provided context, I cannot provide any specific guidance on upgrading the PyTorch version based on this information alone. Upgrading PyTorch typically involves following the installation instructions on the official PyTorch website (https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for your specific platform and Python environment.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you have a Python codebase that uses PyTorch and you need assistance with upgrading the PyTorch version, please provide the relevant Python code and environment details, and I'll be happy to help you with the upgrade process based on the official PyTorch upgrade guide.
