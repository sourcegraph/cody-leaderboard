# CHAT_QUESTION Are you capable of upgrading my pytorch version to 1.0.0, there is a guide in the pytorch site

# CHAT_REPLY Unfortunately, the provided codebase context does not contain any information related to PyTorch or instructions on how to upgrade its version. The context appears to be about a code search engine called Zoekt, written in Go.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To upgrade PyTorch to version 1.0.0, you would typically follow the installation instructions provided on the official PyTorch website (https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). The specific steps may vary depending on your operating system and whether you want to install PyTorch with CPU or GPU support.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY In general, the process involves:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. Uninstalling any previous versions of PyTorch.
# CHAT_REPLY 2. Creating a new virtual environment (recommended) or using an existing one.
# CHAT_REPLY 3. Following the instructions on the PyTorch website to install the desired version (1.0.0 in your case) using either pip or conda, depending on your preference.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The PyTorch website also provides detailed guides and notes for different platforms and configurations, so it's recommended to follow those instructions carefully.
