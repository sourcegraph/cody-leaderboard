# CHAT_QUESTION Are you capable of upgrading my pytorch version to 1.0.0, there is a guide in the pytorch site

# CHAT_REPLY Unfortunately, the provided codebase context does not contain any information related to PyTorch or upgrading its version. The context appears to be about a code search engine called Zoekt, written in Go. Without any relevant code or context about PyTorch, I cannot provide guidance on upgrading its version. The context does not seem to be related to your question.
