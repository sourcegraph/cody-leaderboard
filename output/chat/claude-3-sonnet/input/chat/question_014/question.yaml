# CHAT_QUESTION Are you capable of upgrading my pytorch version to 1.0.0, there is a guide in the pytorch site

# CHAT_REPLY Unfortunately, the provided codebase context does not seem to be related to PyTorch or Python at all. The context appears to be about a Go program called Zoekt, which is a text search engine intended for use with source code.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Since there is no information about PyTorch or Python in the given context, I cannot provide any specific guidance on upgrading your PyTorch version to 1.0.0. However, I can provide some general advice:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. Check the official PyTorch website (https://pytorch.org/) for installation instructions and guides on upgrading to the latest version.
# CHAT_REPLY 2. If you're using a virtual environment or a package manager like pip or conda, you can typically upgrade PyTorch by running a command like `pip install --upgrade torch==1.0.0` or `conda install pytorch=1.0.0`.
# CHAT_REPLY 3. Make sure to check the PyTorch release notes and any potential breaking changes or compatibility issues when upgrading to a new major version.
# CHAT_REPLY 4. If you're using PyTorch in a specific project or application, it's a good idea to test your code thoroughly after upgrading to ensure compatibility and catch any potential issues.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you need more specific assistance or have additional context related to your PyTorch setup, please provide that information, and I'll do my best to help you further.
