# CHAT_QUESTION Mind taking a second look at the file? @limit.go

# CHAT_REPLY Sure, let me provide a high-level overview of the `limit.go` file:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The `limit.go` file contains functions and types related to limiting and truncating the search results in the Zoekt code search engine. It defines the `DisplayTruncator` type, which is a stateful function that enforces document and match display limits by truncating the results before returning them.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The `NewDisplayTruncator` function creates a new `DisplayTruncator` based on the provided search options, such as `MaxDocDisplayCount` and `MaxMatchDisplayCount`. If there are no limits to enforce, it returns a no-op `DisplayTruncator`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The `SortAndTruncateFiles` function is a convenience function that sorts the `FileMatch` results and then truncates them based on the search options using the `DisplayTruncator`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The file also includes functions like `limitChunkMatches` and `limitLineMatches` that handle limiting the number of chunk matches and line matches, respectively, in a `FileMatch` result.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Overall, this file plays a crucial role in managing and limiting the search results to prevent overwhelming the system with too many matches and to provide a better user experience by displaying only the most relevant results.
