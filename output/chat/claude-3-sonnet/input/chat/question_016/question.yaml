# CHAT_QUESTION Mind taking a second look at the file? @limit.go

# CHAT_REPLY Sure, let's take a look at limit.go:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY This file contains functions related to limiting the number of matches and file results returned from a search query. Here are some key points:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. `SortAndTruncateFiles` sorts the `FileMatch` results and then truncates them based on the `SearchOptions` limits like `MaxDocDisplayCount` and `MaxMatchDisplayCount`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. `NewDisplayTruncator` returns a `DisplayTruncator` function that enforces the display limits by truncating the `FileMatch` slices. If no limits are set, it returns a no-op function.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. `limitMatches` is a helper that applies either `limitChunkMatches` or `limitLineMatches` to each `FileMatch` based on the `ChunkMatches` option.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. `limitChunkMatches` truncates the `ChunkMatches` and their associated `Ranges`, `SymbolInfo`, and `Content` fields to the specified limit.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. `limitLineMatches` simply truncates the `LineMatches` field to the specified limit.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The file seems to handle limiting and truncating search results in various ways, like capping the number of files, capping the number of line/chunk matches per file, and truncating the content previews. This is likely important for performance and memory usage, especially for very broad searches that could return a massive number of results.
