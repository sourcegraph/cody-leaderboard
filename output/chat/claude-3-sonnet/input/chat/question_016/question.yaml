# CHAT_QUESTION Mind taking a second look at the file? @limit.go

# CHAT_REPLY Sure, let's take a look at limit.go. This file contains functions related to limiting the number of matches and file results returned from a search query. Here's a high-level overview:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The main functions are:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. SortAndTruncateFiles - Sorts the file matches and truncates them based on the search options (max document and match display counts).
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. NewDisplayTruncator - Returns a function that enforces the document and match display limits by truncating the results.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. limitMatches - Limits the number of chunk or line matches in each file match based on the specified limit.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. limitChunkMatches - Limits the chunk matches, potentially truncating the content as well to remove excess lines.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. limitLineMatches - Limits the line matches for a file.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY These functions work together to ensure the search results don't exceed the specified limits for the number of documents, matches per document, and total matches returned. The truncation logic takes into account factors like context lines and multiline matches.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The key things to note are the various limits that can be specified in the SearchOptions, and how the code intelligently truncates the results while preserving important information like context lines and non-overlapping matches.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Overall, this file provides a way to control the size of the search results and prevent excessive memory usage or processing for very broad queries.
