# CHAT_QUESTION Mind taking a second look at the file? @limit.go

# CHAT_REPLY Sure, let's take a look at limit.go:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY This file contains functions related to limiting the number of matches and file matches returned in search results. Here are some key points:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. `SortAndTruncateFiles` sorts the `FileMatch` slice and then truncates it based on the `SearchOptions` (e.g. `MaxDocDisplayCount`).
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. `NewDisplayTruncator` returns a `DisplayTruncator` function that enforces limits on the number of documents and matches displayed. If no limits are set, it returns a no-op function.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. `limitMatches` is a helper that limits the number of `ChunkMatches` or `LineMatches` in each `FileMatch` based on `MaxMatchDisplayCount`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. `limitChunkMatches` truncates the `Ranges`, `SymbolInfo`, and `Content` fields of each `ChunkMatch` to fit within the specified limit. It handles multi-line ranges and context lines correctly.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. `limitLineMatches` simply truncates the `LineFragments` slice of each `LineMatch` to fit within the specified limit.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY These functions are used to prevent returning an excessive number of matches and files, which could potentially cause performance issues or consume too much memory. They allow the search to be bounded while still returning the most relevant results.
