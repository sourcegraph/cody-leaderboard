# CHAT_QUESTION Mind taking a second look at the file? @limit.go

# CHAT_REPLY Sure, let's take a look at limit.go:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY This file contains functions related to limiting the number of matches and file matches returned in search results. Here are some key points:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. `SortAndTruncateFiles` sorts the list of `FileMatch` results and then truncates it based on the `SearchOptions` (e.g. `MaxDocDisplayCount`).
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. `NewDisplayTruncator` returns a `DisplayTruncator` function that enforces limits on the number of documents and matches displayed. It considers options like `MaxDocDisplayCount` and `MaxMatchDisplayCount`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. `limitMatches` is a helper that limits the number of `ChunkMatches` or `LineMatches` in each `FileMatch` based on the specified limit.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. `limitChunkMatches` limits the number of `ChunkMatches` in a `FileMatch`. It handles truncating the `Content` field and `SymbolInfo` field accordingly.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. `limitLineMatches` limits the number of `LineMatches` in a `FileMatch`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The main purpose of these functions is to control the amount of data returned in search results, preventing excessive memory usage or network transfer for large result sets. By limiting the number of files, line matches, and chunk matches, the search can return a reasonable subset of the full results based on the specified options.
