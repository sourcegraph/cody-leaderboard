# CHAT
# CHAT_REPLY The `@sourcegraph/cody-agent` package enables non-ECMAScript clients, such as JetBrains and NeoVim plugins, to interact with Cody. It achieves this by implementing a JSON-RPC server that communicates via standard input/output streams (stdout/stdin). 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Here's a breakdown:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **`@sourcegraph/cody-agent`**: This refers to a specific software package named "cody-agent" within the "@sourcegraph" organization or namespace.
# CHAT_REPLY * **JSON-RPC server**: This indicates that the package sets up a server that adheres to the JSON-RPC protocol. JSON-RPC is a lightweight remote procedure call protocol that uses JSON for data transmission.
# CHAT_REPLY * **stdout/stdin**: These stand for "standard output" and "standard input," respectively. They are communication channels used by computer programs to exchange data.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Non-ECMAScript clients**: This specifies that the package is designed for clients written in programming languages other than ECMAScript (which includes JavaScript).
# CHAT_REPLY * **JetBrains and NeoVim plugins**: These are examples of clients that might use the `cody-agent` package. JetBrains develops IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA, and NeoVim is a text editor.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY In essence, the `cody-agent` package acts as a bridge, allowing plugins and tools outside the typical JavaScript ecosystem to leverage Cody's capabilities by sending requests and receiving responses in a standardized JSON format.
