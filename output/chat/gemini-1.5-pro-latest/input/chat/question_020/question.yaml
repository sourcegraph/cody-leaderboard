# CHAT_QUESTION explain @README.md

# CHAT_REPLY The file `mocked_context/README.md` you provided describes a software package called `@sourcegraph/cody-agent`. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Here's a breakdown:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **Purpose:** This package allows non-JavaScript programs (like plugins for JetBrains IDEs or NeoVim) to communicate with Cody. 
# CHAT_REPLY * **Mechanism:** It achieves this communication by setting up a JSON-RPC server. This server interacts with Cody through standard input/output streams (stdin/stdout).
# CHAT_REPLY * **Target Audience:** This package is not intended for typical JavaScript developers. Instead, it's designed for developers building Cody integrations in other programming languages and environments.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY In essence, this package acts as a bridge, enabling Cody's capabilities to be used in a wider range of developer tools and editors.
