# CHAT_QUESTION \@zoekt describe my code.

# CHAT_REPLY I'm sorry, but I need more context to understand your request. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **"My code" is too vague.** Please provide the specific code snippet you'd like me to describe. 
# CHAT_REPLY * **Tell me what you want to know.** Do you want a general overview, an explanation of specific functions, or something else?
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY For example, you could say:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * "Describe the function `NewRateLimitWithPercentageConcurrency` in `limit.go`."
# CHAT_REPLY * "Explain how the `concurrencyLimiter` struct works in `limit.go`."
# CHAT_REPLY * "What is the purpose of the `@sourcegraph/cody-agent` package?"
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Please provide me with more information so I can assist you better.
