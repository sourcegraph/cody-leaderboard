# CHAT_QUESTION \@zoekt describe my code.

# CHAT_REPLY I'm sorry, but I need more context than just file names and their contents to understand what you mean by "your code". Please provide me with the code you want me to describe. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY For example, you could tell me:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **The specific file and lines of code you're interested in.**  For example, "Can you describe the `concurrencyLimiter` struct in `limit.go`?"
# CHAT_REPLY * **The functionality you're trying to achieve.** For example, "I'm trying to implement rate limiting for Cody agents. Can you describe how the code achieves that?"
# CHAT_REPLY * **The specific part of the codebase you're working on.** For example, "I'm working on the JetBrains plugin for Cody. Can you describe how the `@sourcegraph/cody-agent` package is used?"
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The more information you give me, the better I can understand your request and provide a helpful description.
