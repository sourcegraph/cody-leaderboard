# CHAT_QUESTION \@zoekt describe my code.

# CHAT_REPLY I can tell you're working with a codebase that uses Go and TypeScript, and it seems to be related to Sourcegraph's Cody, specifically a component called "Cody Agent". 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Here's a breakdown based on the provided files:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY **Go Code:**
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **agent.go:** Defines a package `agent` and a placeholder for an `Agent` type. This suggests a core component of the Cody Agent.
# CHAT_REPLY * **limit.go:** Implements rate limiting and concurrency control, likely for managing requests to the Cody Agent. 
# CHAT_REPLY     * It uses Redis for storing rate limit information.
# CHAT_REPLY     * It defines different limiters like `concurrencyLimiter` and `updateOnErrorLimiter` to handle various scenarios.
# CHAT_REPLY     * It has logic for handling rate limit exceed errors, including retry mechanisms and informative error messages.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY **TypeScript Code:**
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **squirrel.ts:** Defines interfaces for a `CodeIntelligence` API called `Squirrel`. This might be related to Cody's code intelligence capabilities.
# CHAT_REPLY * **animal.ts:** Defines a basic `Animal` interface, likely for example purposes or unrelated to the core functionality.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY **Other Files:**
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **README.md:** Provides a high-level description of the `@sourcegraph/cody-agent` package, stating its purpose as a JSON-RPC server for non-ECMAScript clients to interact with Cody.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY **Overall:**
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The code suggests that Cody Agent acts as an intermediary between Cody and non-ECMAScript clients, handling communication and potentially enforcing usage limits. The `Squirrel` API might be how the agent interacts with Cody's code intelligence features. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY However, without more context and the actual implementation of the `Agent` type, it's difficult to provide a more precise description.
