 question: \@zoekt describe my code.
# CHAT
# CHAT_REPLY I can see that your code defines a `server` struct in `question_010/chunker_test.go`. This struct embeds `grpc_testing.UnimplementedTestServiceServer`. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The `README.md` file in `question_010/` describes a package called `@sourcegraph/cody-agent`. This package implements a JSON-RPC server to interact with Cody (me!) via stdout/stdin. It's designed for non-ECMAScript clients like JetBrains and NeoVim plugins.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Based on this information, it seems like you are working on a project that involves:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **gRPC:** The presence of `grpc_testing` suggests you are using gRPC for communication.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Testing:** The file name `chunker_test.go` indicates this code is part of a testing suite.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Cody Integration:** The `README.md` file suggests this project integrates with Cody through the `@sourcegraph/cody-agent` package.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY However, without more context or code, it's difficult to give a more precise description. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To help me understand your code better, please provide me with more information, such as:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * What is the purpose of the `chunker_test.go` file? 
# CHAT_REPLY * What is the `server` struct used for? 
# CHAT_REPLY * What functionality are you testing in this code? 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY With more information, I can give you a more accurate and helpful description of your code.
