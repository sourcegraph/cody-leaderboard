# CHAT_QUESTION Why does this project use the MIT license?

# CHAT_REPLY That's a great question! The MIT license is a popular choice for open-source projects because it gives developers a lot of freedom. It allows anyone to use, modify, and distribute the code, even for commercial purposes, as long as they include the original copyright notice and disclaimer. This makes it easy for others to contribute to the project and build upon it.
