# CHAT_QUESTION Why does this project use the MIT license?

# CHAT_REPLY The provided context does not contain the answer to why this project uses the MIT license. However, it does mention that the project is a fork of Google's Zoekt project, now maintained by Sourcegraph. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To understand the licensing choice, you would typically look for these things:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **LICENSE file:** Most projects include a LICENSE file in the root directory explicitly stating the license.
# CHAT_REPLY * **README file:** The README might mention licensing information, especially if it's a fork and wants to clarify any changes.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Project website or repository:**  Places like GitHub or the project's official website often display licensing information prominently.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Without access to those sources, it's impossible to definitively say why the MIT license was chosen. However, the MIT license is a very permissive open-source license, making it a common choice for projects wanting to encourage wide adoption and modification.
