**How to use it:**

1. **Include the CSS:** Add the above CSS code to your stylesheet or within a `<style>` tag in your HTML.
2. **Add the HTML:** Use the following HTML structure for your checkbox:

```html
<label class=""my-checkbox-label"">My Checkbox
  <input type=""checkbox"">
  <span class=""checkmark""></span>
</label>
```

**Explanation:**

- **Label:** The `.my-checkbox-label` styles the label and makes it clickable.
- **Hidden Input:** The `input[type=""checkbox""]` is hidden but still functional.
- **Custom Checkbox:** The `.checkmark` element creates the visible checkbox.
- **Checked State:** When the checkbox is checked, the `.checkmark` gets a light purple background color.
- **Checkmark:** The `.checkmark:after` creates the checkmark symbol using borders and is only visible when the checkbox is checked.

This code provides a basic styled checkbox with a light purple color. You can further customize the appearance by adjusting the CSS properties like colors, sizes, borders, and more.",,,,,,,,,,,

Here's how it generally works:

1. **Registration:** You specify the target directory and the types of events you're interested in (e.g., file creation, modification, deletion, renaming).
2. **Monitoring:** The watcher sets up a mechanism to listen for changes in the operating system's file system events related to the watched directory.
3. **Event Detection:** When a change occurs, the operating system notifies the watcher.
4. **Event Handling:** The watcher triggers pre-defined actions or functions based on the detected event and provides information about the change (e.g., file name, timestamp, type of change).

**Common uses of directory watchers:**

* **Development workflows:** Automatically trigger actions like recompiling code, running tests, or refreshing a browser window when code files are saved.
* **File synchronization:** Detect changes in a local directory and synchronize them with a remote server or another device.
* **Backup systems:** Identify new or modified files for incremental backups.
* **Log monitoring:** Process new log entries in real-time for analysis or alerting.
* **Media processing:** Automatically start processing new media files added to a directory.

**Implementation:**

Directory watchers can be implemented using various programming languages and libraries, often leveraging operating system-specific APIs:

* **Python:** `watchdog`
* **Node.js:** `chokidar`, `fs.watch`
* **Java:** `WatchService` (Java NIO.2)
* **Go:** `fsnotify`
* **.NET:** `FileSystemWatcher`

**Benefits of using directory watchers:**

* **Automation:** Eliminates the need for manual intervention or periodic checks for changes.
* **Real-time responsiveness:** Enables immediate reactions to file system events.
* **Efficiency:** Reduces unnecessary processing by only reacting to actual changes.

By understanding the capabilities of directory watchers, you can leverage them to automate tasks, improve efficiency, and build more responsive applications.",,,,,,,,,,,

The `updateOnErrorLimiter` struct uses a goroutine to update an `Actor` object in the background.

* When `TryAcquire` is called, it first tries to acquire a limit using its `nextLimiter`.
* If this results in a `limiter.NoAccessError` or `limiter.RateLimitExceededError`, it means the actor might have updated access permissions.
* Instead of blocking the main thread, a new goroutine is launched using `go func() {...}()`.
* This goroutine calls the `actor.Update` method to refresh the actor's permissions in the background.
* If `actor.Update` returns an error (and it's not a recent update error), a warning is logged.

This approach ensures that even if an actor's permissions need updating, the main request can still proceed without waiting for the update to complete. The update happens asynchronously in the background.",,,,,,,,,,,

**1. Rate Limiting:**

* **`RateLimit` struct:**
    * Defines the structure for rate limiting configuration.
    * `AllowedModels`: List of allowed models for this rate limit. A single ""*"" allows all models.
    * `Limit`: Maximum number of requests allowed within the `Interval`.
    * `Interval`: Time window for the rate limit.
    * `ConcurrentRequests`: Maximum concurrent requests allowed.
    * `ConcurrentRequestsInterval`: Time window for the concurrency limit.
* **`NewRateLimitWithPercentageConcurrency` function:**
    * Creates a new `RateLimit` instance, calculating the `ConcurrentRequests` based on a percentage of the daily request limit.
* **`IsValid` method:**
    * Checks if the `RateLimit` configuration is valid (non-nil, positive values for limits and intervals).
* **`EvaluateAllowedModels` method:**
    * Determines the allowed models by intersecting the actor's allowed models with a master allowlist.
    * Returns the intersection, ensuring only models from the master allowlist are considered.

**2. Concurrency Limiting:**

* **`concurrencyLimiter` struct:**
    * Implements concurrency limiting for an actor.
    * `logger`: Logger instance for recording events.
    * `actor`: The actor to which the concurrency limit applies.
    * `feature`: The feature being rate limited.
    * `redis`: Redis store for tracking rate limit counters.
    * `concurrentRequests`: Maximum concurrent requests allowed.
    * `concurrentInterval`: Time window for the concurrency limit.
    * `nextLimiter`: The next limiter in the chain (potentially a rate limiter).
    * `nowFunc`: Function to get the current time (for testing).
* **`TryAcquire` method:**
    * Attempts to acquire a concurrency slot.
    * Uses a `limiter.StaticLimiter` backed by Redis to enforce the concurrency limit.
    * If successful, calls the `TryAcquire` method of the `nextLimiter`.
    * Returns an `ErrConcurrencyLimitExceeded` error if the concurrency limit is reached.
* **`Usage` method:**
    * Delegates to the `Usage` method of the `nextLimiter`.

**3. Error Handling:**

* **`ErrConcurrencyLimitExceeded` struct:**
    * Represents an error when the concurrency limit is exceeded.
    * Provides methods for generating error messages and HTTP responses.
* **`updateOnErrorLimiter` struct:**
    * Wraps another limiter and attempts to update the actor's information if an access error occurs.
    * This allows for dynamic updates to an actor's permissions.

**In summary:**

The `limit.go` file provides mechanisms for both rate limiting and concurrency limiting requests made by actors. It uses Redis to store rate limit counters and allows for flexible configuration of limits and intervals. The code also includes error handling and mechanisms for updating actor information in case of access issues.",,,,,,,,,,,
