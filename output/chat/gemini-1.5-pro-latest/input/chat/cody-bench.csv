* **Indexing:** Zoekt can index both directories and Git repositories, including support for specific branches. It also has specialized indexing for large-scale code hosting solutions like Gerrit.
* **Searching:**  You can search using a web interface, a command-line interface (CLI), or a JSON API. Zoekt supports sophisticated queries involving regular expressions, file names, branches, and more.
* **Ranking and Filtering:** Zoekt utilizes various techniques for ranking search results, including BM25 scoring and symbol analysis (using ctags). It allows filtering results by repository, branches, and programming language.
* **Performance:** Zoekt is built for speed and efficiency. It employs strategies like sharding, result truncation, and match tree pruning to handle large codebases.

The codebase also includes features like:

* **Repository listing:**  You can list repositories based on certain criteria.
* **Result display:** Zoekt provides options for limiting the number of matches and documents displayed, as well as controlling the context lines shown around each match.

**1. Lightweight Threads, Not OS Threads:**

* Goroutines are **not** traditional operating system threads. They are managed entirely by the Go runtime.
* This means they are incredibly lightweight. You can have thousands, even millions, of goroutines running concurrently without overwhelming your system.
* The Go runtime handles scheduling these goroutines onto a smaller number of OS threads (called ""M"" in Go's terminology), effectively multiplexing many goroutines onto fewer threads.

**2. Starting a Goroutine:**

* You start a goroutine by simply adding the keyword `go` before a function call:

   ```go
   func myFunc() {
       // Do something
   }

   func main() {
       go myFunc() // Run myFunc concurrently
       // ... rest of your code
   }
   ```

* This launches `myFunc` as a separate, independent goroutine that runs concurrently with the rest of the `main` function.

**3. Communication and Synchronization:**

* Goroutines communicate with each other primarily through **channels**. 
* Channels are typed conduits that allow you to safely send and receive data between goroutines. This helps avoid race conditions and other concurrency pitfalls.

   ```go
   func worker(id int, jobs <-chan int, results chan<- int) {
       for j := range jobs {
           results <- j * 2 // Send result back through the channel
       }
   }

   func main() {
       jobs := make(chan int, 100)
       results := make(chan int, 100)

       for w := 1; w <= 3; w++ {
           go worker(w, jobs, results) 
       }

       for j := 1; j <= 5; j++ {
           jobs <- j // Send jobs to workers
       }
       close(jobs)

       for a := 1; a <= 5; a++ {
           fmt.Println(<-results) // Receive results from workers
       }
   }
   ```

* Goroutines can also synchronize their execution using **sync primitives** like `sync.Mutex` and `sync.WaitGroup`.

**4. The Go Scheduler:**

* The Go runtime includes a sophisticated scheduler that manages the execution of goroutines.
* It distributes goroutines across available OS threads, ensuring that all goroutines get a chance to run.
* The scheduler uses a cooperative multitasking model, meaning goroutines yield control voluntarily at specific points (e.g., channel operations, function calls).

**Key Advantages of Goroutines:**

* **Lightweight:** Low memory overhead, allowing for massive concurrency.
* **Efficient:** Multiplexing onto fewer OS threads reduces context switching costs.
* **Simplified Concurrency:** Channels and sync primitives provide safe and structured ways to manage concurrent operations.
* **Improved Performance:**  Can significantly improve the performance of I/O-bound and CPU-bound tasks by utilizing multiple processor cores.
