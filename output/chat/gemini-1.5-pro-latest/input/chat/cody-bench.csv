**Understanding Slices**

* **Dynamically Sized:** Unlike arrays, which have a fixed length defined at compile time, slices can grow or shrink dynamically during runtime.
* **Reference Types:** Slices are reference types. This means that when you pass a slice to a function or assign it to another variable, you are actually passing a reference to the underlying array data.
* **Underlying Array:**  A slice is a lightweight data structure that points to an underlying array. It stores:
    * A pointer to the first element of the array.
    * The length of the slice (number of elements it currently contains).
    * The capacity of the slice (maximum number of elements it can hold before needing to resize the underlying array).

**Declaring and Initializing Slices**

1. **Slice Literal (Similar to Array):**
   ```go
   mySlice := []int{1, 2, 3, 4} // Type is inferred
   ```

2. **Using `make` Function:**
   ```go
   mySlice := make([]string, 5) // Creates a slice with length and capacity of 5
   mySlice[0] = ""hello""
   ```

3. **Slicing an Existing Array or Slice:**
   ```go
   arr := [5]int{10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
   mySlice := arr[1:4] // mySlice contains {20, 30, 40}
   ```

**Key Operations**

* **`len(slice)`:** Returns the current length (number of elements) of the slice.
* **`cap(slice)`:** Returns the current capacity of the slice.
* **`append(slice, elements...)`: ** Appends elements to the end of a slice. If the slice's capacity is reached, a new underlying array is allocated, and the existing elements are copied over.
* **`copy(dest, src)`:** Copies elements from one slice to another.
* **Slicing:** You can create sub-slices using the `slice[low:high]` syntax (similar to Python).

**Example**

```go
package main

import ""fmt""

func main() {
    numbers := []int{2, 4, 6}
    fmt.Println(""Initial slice:"", numbers)

    numbers = append(numbers, 8, 10)
    fmt.Println(""After appending:"", numbers)

    part := numbers[1:3] 
    fmt.Println(""Sliced portion:"", part) 
}
```

**Important Considerations**

* **Zero Value:** The zero value of a slice is `nil`. A `nil` slice has a length and capacity of 0.
* **Passing to Functions:** When you pass a slice to a function, modifications made to the slice's elements inside the function will affect the original slice. However, if the function appends elements that increase the slice's length beyond its capacity, a new underlying array is created, and changes won't be reflected in the original slice.

* `a|e|i|o|u`: Matches a single character that is one of the vowels.

```css

**1. Lightweight Threads, Not OS Threads:**

* Goroutines are **not** traditional operating system threads. They are managed entirely by the Go runtime.
* This means they are incredibly lightweight. You can have thousands, even millions, of goroutines running concurrently without overwhelming your system.
* The Go runtime handles scheduling these goroutines onto a smaller number of OS threads (called ""M"" in Go's terminology), effectively multiplexing many goroutines onto fewer threads.

**2. Starting a Goroutine:**

* You start a goroutine by simply adding the keyword `go` before a function call:

   ```go
   func myFunc() {
       // Do something
   }

   func main() {
       go myFunc() // Run myFunc concurrently
       // ... rest of your code
   }
   ```

* This launches `myFunc` as a separate, independent goroutine that runs concurrently with the rest of the `main` function.

**3. Communication and Synchronization:**

* Goroutines communicate with each other primarily through **channels**. 
* Channels are typed conduits that allow you to safely send and receive data between goroutines. This helps avoid race conditions and other concurrency pitfalls.

   ```go
   func worker(id int, jobs <-chan int, results chan<- int) {
       for j := range jobs {
           results <- j * 2 // Send result back through the channel
       }
   }

   func main() {
       jobs := make(chan int, 100)
       results := make(chan int, 100)

       for w := 1; w <= 3; w++ {
           go worker(w, jobs, results) 
       }

       for j := 1; j <= 5; j++ {
           jobs <- j // Send jobs to workers
       }
       close(jobs)

       for a := 1; a <= 5; a++ {
           fmt.Println(<-results) // Receive results from workers
       }
   }
   ```

* Goroutines can also synchronize their execution using **sync primitives** like `sync.Mutex` and `sync.WaitGroup`.

**4. The Go Scheduler:**

* The Go runtime includes a sophisticated scheduler that manages the execution of goroutines.
* It distributes goroutines across available OS threads, ensuring that all goroutines get a chance to run.
* The scheduler uses a cooperative multitasking model, meaning goroutines yield control voluntarily at specific points (e.g., channel operations, function calls).

**Key Advantages of Goroutines:**

* **Lightweight:** Low memory overhead, allowing for massive concurrency.
* **Efficient:** Multiplexing onto fewer OS threads reduces context switching costs.
* **Simplified Concurrency:** Channels and sync primitives provide safe and structured ways to manage concurrent operations.
* **Improved Performance:**  Can significantly improve the performance of I/O-bound and CPU-bound tasks by utilizing multiple processor cores.

- **`DisplayTruncator`**: This is a stateful function type that enforces document and match display limits. It takes a list of file matches and returns a potentially truncated list, along with a boolean indicating if more results are available.

- **`NewDisplayTruncator`**: This function creates a `DisplayTruncator` based on the provided search options. It determines if any limits are set and returns the appropriate truncator function.

- **`limitMatches`**: This function applies match limits to a list of file matches. It uses either `limitChunkMatches` or `limitLineMatches` based on the `chunkMatches` option.

- **`limitChunkMatches`**: This function limits the number of `ChunkMatches` within each `FileMatch`. It truncates the `Ranges`, `SymbolInfo`, and `Content` fields accordingly.

- **`limitLineMatches`**: This function limits the number of `LineMatches` within each `FileMatch` by truncating the `LineFragments` field.
