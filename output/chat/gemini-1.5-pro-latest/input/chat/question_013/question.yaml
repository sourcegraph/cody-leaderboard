# CHAT_QUESTION where do we test the grpc chunker

# CHAT_REPLY The provided snippets don't contain enough information to determine where the gRPC chunker is tested. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To figure out where the gRPC chunker tests are, I need more context. Specifically:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **What is the "gRPC chunker"?**  Is it a specific function, a module, or a concept within the codebase?  Knowing what it refers to will help me narrow down the search.
# CHAT_REPLY * **File paths:**  Knowing the directory structure and file names related to gRPC functionality would be helpful.  For example, are there files named `grpc_client.go`, `grpc_server.go`, or something similar?
# CHAT_REPLY * **Test file naming conventions:**  Does the project follow a specific pattern for naming test files (e.g., `*_test.go`)?
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Please provide more information about the codebase or the "gRPC chunker" so I can assist you better.
