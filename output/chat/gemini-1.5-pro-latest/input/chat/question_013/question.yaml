# CHAT_QUESTION where do we test the grpc chunker

# CHAT_REPLY The provided snippets don't contain enough information to determine where the gRPC chunker is tested. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To figure out where the gRPC chunker tests are, I need more context.  Please provide the following:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **File path:** What is the full path to the file containing the `chunker_test.go` file? This helps me understand the project structure.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Chunker implementation:** Can you share the code for the gRPC chunker itself? This will help me identify related files and test patterns.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Project structure:** Are there any specific directories where tests are typically located (e.g., a `tests` directory)?
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY With more information, I can help you find where the gRPC chunker is tested.
