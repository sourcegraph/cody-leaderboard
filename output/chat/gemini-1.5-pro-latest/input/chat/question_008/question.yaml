# CHAT_QUESTION What does this repo do??

# CHAT_REPLY It's difficult to say exactly what this repo *does* based on just this file. However, I can tell you that this code snippet:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **Belongs to a Go package named `zoekt`**. This suggests the larger project might be a search engine or have a strong search component. 
# CHAT_REPLY * **Deals with limiting and truncating search results**.  The code defines functions for:
# CHAT_REPLY     * Sorting and truncating lists of `FileMatch` objects, which likely represent files matching a search query.
# CHAT_REPLY     * Creating a `DisplayTruncator` that enforces limits on the number of documents and matches displayed.
# CHAT_REPLY     * Limiting the number of `ChunkMatches` and `LineMatches` within a `FileMatch`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY **In short, this code seems to handle the display and presentation of search results, specifically focusing on limiting the amount of data shown to the user.** 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To get a clearer picture of the repo's overall purpose, you'd need to look at other files and potentially documentation.
