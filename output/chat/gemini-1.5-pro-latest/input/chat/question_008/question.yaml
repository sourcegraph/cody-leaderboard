# CHAT_QUESTION What does this repo do??

# CHAT_REPLY This codebase appears to be part of a search engine, specifically the part responsible for displaying search results. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY It includes functionality for:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **Sorting search results:**  The `SortFiles` function likely handles ordering results based on relevance or other criteria.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Truncating results:** The `DisplayTruncator` and related functions limit the number of documents and matches shown to the user, based on settings like `MaxDocDisplayCount` and `MaxMatchDisplayCount`.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Chunking matches:** The code handles both individual line matches and "chunk matches," which could refer to grouping consecutive matching lines together. 
# CHAT_REPLY * **Highlighting:** While not explicitly stated, the presence of `Content` and `LineFragments` suggests that this codebase might also handle highlighting matching terms within the displayed results. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Let me know if you have any other questions about this code.
