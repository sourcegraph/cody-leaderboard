# CHAT_QUESTION describe my code

# CHAT_REPLY This codebase implements a fast text search engine called Zoekt, specifically designed for searching source code. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Here's a breakdown:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **Indexing:** Zoekt can index both directories and Git repositories, including support for specific branches. It also has specialized indexing for large-scale code hosting solutions like Gerrit.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Searching:**  You can search using a web interface, a command-line interface (CLI), or a JSON API. Zoekt supports sophisticated queries involving regular expressions, file names, branches, and more.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Ranking and Filtering:** Zoekt utilizes various techniques for ranking search results, including BM25 scoring and symbol analysis (using ctags). It allows filtering results by repository, branches, and programming language.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Performance:** Zoekt is built for speed and efficiency. It employs strategies like sharding, result truncation, and match tree pruning to handle large codebases.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The codebase also includes features like:
