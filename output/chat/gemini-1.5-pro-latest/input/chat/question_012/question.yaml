# CHAT_QUESTION Is my codebase clean?

# CHAT_REPLY It's great that you're thinking about code cleanliness!  Maintaining a clean codebase is an ongoing process, and there are always ways to improve. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To give you the most helpful advice, I need a little more direction. Could you tell me:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **What aspects of code cleanliness are you most interested in?** For example, are you concerned about code style, complexity, security vulnerabilities, or something else?
# CHAT_REPLY * **Are there any specific parts of the codebase you're particularly interested in?**  Focusing on a smaller section can make it easier to provide targeted feedback. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Once I have a better understanding of your goals, I can give you more specific guidance on how to evaluate and improve your codebase.
