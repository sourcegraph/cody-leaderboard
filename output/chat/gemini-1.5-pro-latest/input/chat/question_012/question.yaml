 question: Is my codebase clean?

# CHAT_QUESTION Is my codebase clean?

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided code snippets, I cannot determine if your codebase is "clean" in a general sense. "Clean" can be subjective and depend on various factors like coding style, complexity, and potential issues. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY However, I can offer some observations:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **Code Variety:** You have code in Go, TypeScript, and a README file. This suggests a multifaceted project.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Documentation:** The presence of a README suggests an attempt at documentation, which is a good practice.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Specific Functionality:** The code snippets reveal parts of a search engine (Zoekt) with features like indexing, searching, and result limiting. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To assess the cleanliness of your codebase more thoroughly, I would need more context and potentially use code analysis tools. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Could you please provide more information about what you consider "clean" in this context? For example:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **Specific concerns:** Are you worried about code smells, potential bugs, or adherence to a style guide?
# CHAT_REPLY * **Codebase size:** Is this the entirety of your codebase or just a small sample?
# CHAT_REPLY * **Tools:** Do you use any linters or static analysis tools?
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY With more information, I can give you a more helpful and tailored answer.
