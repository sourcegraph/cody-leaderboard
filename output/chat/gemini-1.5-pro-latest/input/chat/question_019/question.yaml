# CHAT_QUESTION Explain the logic in src/agent.go, particularly how agents interact with ranking

# CHAT_REPLY The agents in `src/agent.go` efficiently distribute the search across shards. Each agent is responsible for querying a subset of shards. They don't directly influence ranking; their primary role is to gather results from shards. The ranking process happens after the agents have collected these results.
