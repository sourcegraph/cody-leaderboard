# CHAT_QUESTION Explain the logic in src/agent.go, particularly how agents interact with ranking

# CHAT_REPLY The logic in `src/agent.go` centers around distributing search work and merging results efficiently. Here's how agents interact with ranking:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY - **Parallelism for Speed:** Agents allow Zoekt to search across multiple shards concurrently. Each agent tackles a subset of shards, speeding up the search process.
# CHAT_REPLY - **Ranking during Merging:** As agents complete their shard searches, the `agent` package handles merging these results. During this merge process, ranking plays a crucial role. Results are combined and ordered based on their relevance scores, ensuring the most relevant results appear first.
# CHAT_REPLY - **Optimization for Large Searches:** By distributing work and merging ranked results, `src/agent.go` enables Zoekt to handle large codebases and complex searches effectively. This approach ensures fast and accurate search results, even when dealing with vast amounts of code.
