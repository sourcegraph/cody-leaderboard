# CHAT_QUESTION See zoekt repo find location of tensor function

# CHAT_REPLY Unfortunately, the provided code snippets don't contain any references to a "tensor" function or any code related to tensors. Therefore, I cannot provide a location for it within the Zoekt repository. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To help me find the function, please provide more context:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **What is the purpose of this "tensor" function?** Knowing what it does will help me narrow down the search.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Are there any other relevant keywords or file names?** Any additional information could be helpful. 
# CHAT_REPLY * **Could you provide more code snippets where this function might be used or defined?** This would give me a better understanding of the surrounding code. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY With more information, I can assist you in finding the location of the "tensor" function.
