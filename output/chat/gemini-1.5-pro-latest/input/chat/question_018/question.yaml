# CHAT_QUESTION See zoekt repo find location of tensor function

# CHAT_REPLY To find the location of a "tensor" function within the Zoekt repository, I recommend the following steps:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY **High-Level Overview**
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **Identify Potential Locations:**  Since "tensor" is a common term in machine learning, start by looking in areas of the Zoekt codebase related to scoring, ranking, or any machine learning features.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **Use Your IDE:** Most IDEs have powerful search features. Use your IDE's "Find in Files" or similar functionality to search for "tensor" within the Zoekt repository.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. **Grep:** If you prefer the command line, use `grep` to search for "tensor" recursively within the Zoekt directory.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY **Guidance**
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **Refine Your Search:** If you get too many results, try adding more context to your search term. For example, search for "tensor score" or "calculate tensor" to narrow down the possibilities.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Explore the Codebase:** If the initial search doesn't pinpoint the exact location, don't hesitate to explore the codebase. Look at file and directory names for hints. 
# CHAT_REPLY * **Check Documentation:**  Review the Zoekt documentation for any mentions of "tensor" or related concepts. This might provide clues about where the function is located.
