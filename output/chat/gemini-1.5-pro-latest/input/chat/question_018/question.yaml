# CHAT_QUESTION See zoekt repo find location of tensor function

# CHAT_REPLY The provided code context doesn't contain any references to a "tensor" function or any code related to tensor operations. Therefore, I cannot provide a location for a "tensor" function within the given context. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To better assist you, please provide more context or specify:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **What kind of tensor function are you looking for?** Is it related to machine learning, numerical computation, or something else?
# CHAT_REPLY * **What is the purpose of this function?** What does it do?
# CHAT_REPLY * **Are there any other relevant keywords or file names that could help me narrow down the search?** 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY With more information, I can help you find the relevant code within the "zoekt" repository.
