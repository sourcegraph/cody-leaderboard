# CHAT_QUESTION See zoekt repo find location of tensor function

# CHAT_REPLY To find the location of the "tensor" function in the Zoekt repository, you can use Zoekt's powerful search functionality. Since Zoekt is a text search engine designed specifically for code, it excels at finding specific functions within a codebase. You can use the Zoekt web interface or command-line interface to construct a query that includes the function name "tensor" and any relevant filters, such as specific file types or directories. Zoekt will then return a list of matching results, allowing you to quickly locate the "tensor" function within the repository.
