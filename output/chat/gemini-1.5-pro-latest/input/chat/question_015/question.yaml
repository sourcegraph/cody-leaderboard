 question: Can you look through the files and identify the conflicting packages that may be causing this?
# CHAT
# CHAT_REPLY The provided code snippet doesn't show any conflicting packages. It only uses imports from standard library and a few internal and external packages. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To identify conflicting packages, you would typically look for:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **Same package imported with different paths:** This usually happens when you have a package with the same name in different modules. 
# CHAT_REPLY * **Diamond dependency problem:** This occurs when two different versions of the same package are imported indirectly through different dependencies.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Can you please provide more context or code snippets that might indicate conflicting packages? For example:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **Error messages:**  Share any error messages you are getting, especially those mentioning conflicting packages or versions.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Go.mod file:** The `go.mod` file lists all the dependencies and their versions. Sharing this file can help identify potential conflicts.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Build command and output:** The output of your build command (e.g., `go build`) might contain clues about conflicting packages. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY With more information, I can help you pinpoint the conflicting packages.
