# CHAT_QUESTION Can you look through the files and identify the conflicting packages that may be causing this?

# CHAT_REPLY I cannot identify any conflicting packages from the provided code snippet. There is no indication of package conflicts in the code. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To identify conflicting packages, I would need to see:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **Import statements:** Conflicting packages usually have the same package name but are imported from different sources.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Error messages:** Build errors or runtime errors often provide clues about conflicting packages.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Package management files:** Files like `go.mod` or `go.sum` can help identify package dependencies and potential conflicts.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Please provide more context or code snippets if you suspect package conflicts.
