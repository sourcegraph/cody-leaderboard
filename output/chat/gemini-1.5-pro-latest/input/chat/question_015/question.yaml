# CHAT_QUESTION Can you look through the files and identify the conflicting packages that may be causing this?

# CHAT_REPLY I cannot identify conflicting packages because there is no indication of conflicting packages in the provided code. The code you provided defines functions for sorting and truncating file matches in search results. It does not involve any package imports that could potentially cause conflicts.

 files:
   - ../mocked/codebase_context/README.md
   - ../mocked/codebase_context/limit.go
