# CHAT_QUESTION Can you look through the files and identify the conflicting packages that may be causing this?

# CHAT_REPLY I can certainly take a look at the provided code and offer insights into potential package conflicts. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The code you shared implements logic for sorting and truncating file matches in search results. It doesn't directly involve package management or dependency resolution, so it's unlikely to be the source of package conflicts. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To effectively pinpoint conflicting packages, I'd need more context about your project and the specific error messages you're encountering.  
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY For example, sharing:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **Error messages:**  The exact error messages you see, especially those mentioning package conflicts.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Dependency management tool:** Whether you're using Go modules, dep, or another tool.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Relevant code snippets:**  Parts of your code that import or use the packages suspected to be conflicting.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY This additional information will help me provide more targeted and helpful advice.
