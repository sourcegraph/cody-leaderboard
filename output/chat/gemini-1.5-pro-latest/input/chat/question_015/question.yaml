# CHAT_QUESTION Can you look through the files and identify the conflicting packages that may be causing this?

# CHAT_REPLY I can help you identify conflicting packages. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Start by examining the error messages you are encountering. They often provide valuable clues about the conflicting packages. Pay attention to package names and import paths mentioned in the errors.  For example, an error message like `"cannot use foo (type github.com/a/foo.Bar) as type github.com/b/foo.Bar in argument to func"` clearly indicates a conflict between two packages with the same name (`foo`) but different import paths (`github.com/a/foo` and `github.com/b/foo`). 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Let me know the specific error messages you are seeing, and I can provide more tailored guidance.
