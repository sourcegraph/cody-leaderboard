# CHAT_QUESTION what does @limit.go do?

# CHAT_REPLY The `limit.go` file implements functionality for limiting the number of matches and files returned in a search result. This is important for performance reasons, as displaying a large number of results can be slow and resource-intensive. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Here's a breakdown:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **`SortAndTruncateFiles`**: This function sorts a list of file matches and then truncates it based on the search options provided. 
# CHAT_REPLY * **`DisplayTruncator`**: This is a stateful function that enforces document and match display limits. It takes a list of file matches and returns a truncated list, along with a boolean indicating whether there are more results.
# CHAT_REPLY * **`NewDisplayTruncator`**: This function creates a new `DisplayTruncator` based on the provided search options.
# CHAT_REPLY * **`limitMatches`**: This function limits the number of matches in a list of file matches. It supports limiting by both chunk matches and line matches.
# CHAT_REPLY * **`limitChunkMatches`**: This function limits the number of chunk matches in a single file match.
# CHAT_REPLY * **`limitLineMatches`**: This function limits the number of line matches in a single file match.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Essentially, this code ensures that the search results displayed to the user are concise and manageable, even when searching very large codebases.
