# CHAT_QUESTION what does @limit.go do?

# CHAT_REPLY The `limit.go` file defines functions for truncating search results based on user-specified limits. It offers ways to limit the number of displayed files, matches within files, and even the content of individual matches. This helps to manage the volume of data presented to the user, especially for searches that might otherwise return very large result sets.
