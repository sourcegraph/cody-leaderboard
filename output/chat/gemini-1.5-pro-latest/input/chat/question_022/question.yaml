# CHAT_QUESTION what does @limit.go do?

# CHAT_REPLY The `limit.go` file in the `zoekt` package defines functions for truncating search results based on document and match count limits. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Here's a breakdown:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY - **`SortAndTruncateFiles`**: This function sorts a list of `FileMatch` objects (representing search results) and then truncates the list based on the provided `SearchOptions`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY - **`DisplayTruncator`**: This is a stateful function type that enforces document and match display limits by truncating and mutating a list of `FileMatch` objects. It returns the truncated list and a boolean indicating whether more results are available.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY - **`NewDisplayTruncator`**: This function creates a new `DisplayTruncator` based on the provided `SearchOptions`. It returns the `DisplayTruncator` and a boolean indicating whether any limits are actually being enforced.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY - **`limitMatches`**: This function limits the number of matches (either `ChunkMatches` or `LineMatches`) within a list of `FileMatch` objects. It takes a `chunkMatches` boolean parameter to determine which type of match to limit.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY - **`limitChunkMatches`**: This function limits the number of `ChunkMatches` within a `FileMatch` object. It truncates the `Ranges`, `SymbolInfo`, and `Content` fields of each `ChunkMatch` as needed.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY - **`limitLineMatches`**: This function limits the number of `LineMatches` within a `FileMatch` object by truncating the `LineFragments` field of each `LineMatch`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY In essence, this code ensures that search results displayed to the user do not exceed the configured limits for document count and match count. This helps to prevent overwhelming the user with too much information and improves the performance of displaying search results.
