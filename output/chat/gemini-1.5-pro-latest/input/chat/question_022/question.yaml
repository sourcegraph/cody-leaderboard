# CHAT_QUESTION what does @limit.go do?

# CHAT_REPLY The `limit.go` file in the provided codebase context defines functionality for truncating search results based on document and match display limits. Here's a breakdown:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY **Core Functions:**
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **`SortAndTruncateFiles`**: This function takes a list of `FileMatch` (representing search results) and `SearchOptions`. It sorts the files and then applies truncation based on the limits defined in the search options.
# CHAT_REPLY * **`DisplayTruncator`**: This is a stateful function type that enforces document and match display limits. It takes a list of `FileMatch` and returns a potentially truncated list and a boolean indicating if there are more results (`hasMore`).
# CHAT_REPLY * **`NewDisplayTruncator`**: This function creates a `DisplayTruncator` based on the provided `SearchOptions`. It determines if any limits are actually set and returns a suitable `DisplayTruncator` function.
# CHAT_REPLY * **`limitMatches`**: This function applies the match limit to a list of `FileMatch`. It uses either `limitChunkMatches` or `limitLineMatches` based on the `chunkMatches` option.
# CHAT_REPLY * **`limitChunkMatches`**: This function limits the number of `ChunkMatches` within each `FileMatch`. It handles truncating `Ranges`, `SymbolInfo`, and `Content` accordingly.
# CHAT_REPLY * **`limitLineMatches`**: This function limits the number of `LineMatches` within each `FileMatch` by truncating the `LineFragments`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY **Purpose:**
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The primary goal of this code is to prevent overwhelming users with too many search results. By applying document and match limits, it ensures that the displayed results are concise and manageable. The code also handles different display modes (chunked vs. line-based) and ensures that truncation doesn't leave the data in an inconsistent state.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY **Example:**
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If a search returns 100 matching files but the `MaxDocDisplayCount` is set to 25, the `DisplayTruncator` will truncate the results to the first 25 files. Similarly, if `MaxMatchDisplayCount` is set to 50, the number of matches within each file will be limited to 50.
