 question: Mind taking a second look at the file? @limit.go
# CHAT
# CHAT_REPLY You're right! I apologize for the mistake. I can see now that the file you're asking about is `limit.go`, not `@limit.go`. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY What would you like to know about the `limit.go` file? For example:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **Specific functions or structures:**  Do you want to understand how a particular function like `NewRateLimitWithPercentageConcurrency` works, or the purpose of the `RateLimit` struct?
# CHAT_REPLY * **Overall purpose:** Are you interested in the general goal of the rate limiting logic implemented in this file? 
# CHAT_REPLY * **Relationship to other files:**  Are you curious how this file interacts with other parts of the codebase?
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Please give me more context about what you'd like to know, and I'll do my best to help!
