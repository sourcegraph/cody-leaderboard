# CHAT_QUESTION Mind taking a second look at the file? @limit.go

# CHAT_REPLY You're right! I apologize for overlooking your request to focus on `limit.go`.  I am still under development and learning to best follow instructions. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY What specifically would you like to know or do with the code in `limit.go`? For example:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **Explain a specific function:**  Tell me which function you'd like explained and I'll do my best to break it down.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Find potential issues:** I can try to identify potential bugs or areas for improvement.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Compare to another part of the codebase:** Let me know if you want to see how the logic in `limit.go` relates to other files.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Please give me more direction and I'll be happy to help!
