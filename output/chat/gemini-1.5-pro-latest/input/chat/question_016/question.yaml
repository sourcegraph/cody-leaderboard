# CHAT_QUESTION Mind taking a second look at the file? @limit.go

# CHAT_REPLY You're right! I apologize for overlooking your request to focus on `limit.go`.  
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY It seems I got caught up in processing all the code and missed the specific instruction. Can you tell me what you'd like to know about `limit.go`? For example:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **Do you have a specific question about the code in `limit.go`?** 
# CHAT_REPLY * **Are you looking for an explanation of how a particular function works?**
# CHAT_REPLY * **Do you want to know how this file interacts with other parts of the codebase?**
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The more information you give me, the better I can understand your needs and provide a helpful response.
