# CHAT_QUESTION Mind taking a second look at the file? @limit.go

# CHAT_REPLY The `limit.go` file implements logic for limiting the number of matches and documents returned in a search result. This is important for performance reasons, as returning too many results can be slow and consume a lot of memory. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Here's a breakdown:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **`SortAndTruncateFiles`**: This function sorts files based on relevance and then truncates them based on the provided search options. This ensures that only the most relevant files are returned, up to the specified limit.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **`DisplayTruncator`**: This is a stateful function that enforces document and match display limits. It truncates the list of files and matches to stay within the specified limits.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **`NewDisplayTruncator`**: This function creates a `DisplayTruncator` based on the provided search options. It determines whether any limits need to be enforced and configures the `DisplayTruncator` accordingly.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **`limitMatches`**: This function limits the number of matches within a file, either by chunking or by individual lines.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **`limitChunkMatches`**: This function limits the number of `ChunkMatches` in a file. It handles truncating the content and associated metadata (like symbol information) to stay within the limit.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **`limitLineMatches`**: This function limits the number of `LineMatches` in a file. It's a simpler operation compared to `limitChunkMatches` as it only needs to truncate the list of line fragments.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY In essence, this file provides the tools to efficiently manage the volume of search results, ensuring a balance between comprehensiveness and performance.
