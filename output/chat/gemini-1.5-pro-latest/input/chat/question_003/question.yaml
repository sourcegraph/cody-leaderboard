# CHAT_QUESTION What code do you have access to?

# CHAT_REPLY I have access to the code for the Zoekt codebase, which is a fork of the Google Zoekt project and is now maintained by Sourcegraph. This includes the code for the indexing engine, the web interface, the JSON API, and the command-line interface. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Specifically, the code I have access to includes:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **Indexing:**
# CHAT_REPLY     * Code for indexing directories and Git repositories.
# CHAT_REPLY     * Code for indexing multiple repositories using `zoekt-repo-index`.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Searching:**
# CHAT_REPLY     * Code for the web interface that allows users to search the indexed code.
# CHAT_REPLY     * Code for the JSON API that allows programmatic access to search results.
# CHAT_REPLY     * Code for the command-line interface that allows users to search from the terminal.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Service Management:**
# CHAT_REPLY     * Code for `zoekt-indexserver`, which manages mirroring, indexing, and updating repositories.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Other:**
# CHAT_REPLY     * Code related to symbol search using Universal ctags.
# CHAT_REPLY     * Sourcegraph specific additions like `zoekt-sourcegraph-indexserver` and modifications for symbol search and API exposure.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY However, I do not have access to the actual code files themselves. I can only access the information provided in the `README.md` file you shared.
