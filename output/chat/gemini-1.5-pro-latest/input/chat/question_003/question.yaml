 question: What code do you have access to?
# CHAT
# CHAT_REPLY I have access to the code defining two interfaces:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **`CodeIntelligence`** (from `question_003/squirrel.ts`): This interface represents some code intelligence information and contains a single property:
# CHAT_REPLY     * `symbols`: An array of strings. 
# CHAT_REPLY * **`Squirrel`** (from `question_003/squirrel.ts`): This interface represents a code intelligence API and contains a single method:
# CHAT_REPLY     * `symbolInformation(file: string): CodeIntelligence`: This method takes a file path as a string and returns a `CodeIntelligence` object.
# CHAT_REPLY * **`Animal`** (from `question_003/animal.ts`): This interface represents an animal and contains two properties:
# CHAT_REPLY     * `name`: A string representing the animal's name.
# CHAT_REPLY     * `age`: A number representing the animal's age.
