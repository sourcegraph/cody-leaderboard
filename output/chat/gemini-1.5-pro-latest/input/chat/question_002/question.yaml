# CHAT_QUESTION what is squirrel?

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the code you provided, **Squirrel is a code intelligence API**. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The comment above the interface definition explicitly states its purpose:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY ```typescript
# CHAT_REPLY /**
# CHAT_REPLY  * Squirrel is a code intelligence API.
# CHAT_REPLY  */
# CHAT_REPLY interface Squirrel {
# CHAT_REPLY     symbolInformation(file: string): CodeIntelligence
# CHAT_REPLY }
# CHAT_REPLY ```
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY The interface itself suggests that Squirrel provides at least one method, `symbolInformation`, which takes a file path as input and returns `CodeIntelligence` containing an array of symbols found in that file.
