# CHAT_QUESTION What does directory watcher do?

# CHAT_REPLY The `DirectoryWatcher` monitors a directory for changes to shard files (`.zoekt` files). When it detects new, modified, or deleted shards, it automatically updates the search index by loading or dropping the affected shards. This ensures that the search index remains consistent with the contents of the shard directory.
