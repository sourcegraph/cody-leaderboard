# CHAT_QUESTION What does directory watcher do?

# CHAT_REPLY A directory watcher monitors a specified directory for changes, such as the addition, modification, or deletion of files. When changes occur, it triggers predefined actions, such as loading or unloading data associated with the modified files. This mechanism is particularly useful for keeping data synchronized with the file system in real-time.
