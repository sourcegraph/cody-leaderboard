 question: What does directory watcher do?
# CHAT
# CHAT_QUESTION What does directory watcher do?

# CHAT_REPLY The provided code snippets don't contain information about a "directory watcher". 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY However, based on the context of the `README.md` file describing a text search engine called "Zoekt", a directory watcher would likely be a component responsible for:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **Monitoring a specified directory for changes:** This could include new files, modifications to existing files, or deletions.
# CHAT_REPLY * **Triggering re-indexing:** When changes are detected, the directory watcher would notify the indexing component to update the search index with the latest content.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY This ensures that the search index remains consistent with the contents of the directory being watched, allowing for accurate search results even as the codebase evolves. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Please provide more context or specific code snippets if you have a particular directory watcher implementation in mind.
