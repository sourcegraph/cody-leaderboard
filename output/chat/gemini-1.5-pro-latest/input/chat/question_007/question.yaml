# CHAT_QUESTION how to upgrade my python version?

# CHAT_REPLY I understand you're looking to upgrade your Python version. However, the provided code snippets are related to a Go project ("Cody Agent" within a Sourcegraph codebase) and don't contain information about managing Python versions. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To help you upgrade your Python version, I need more context. Please tell me:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **What operating system are you using?** (Windows, macOS, Linux)
# CHAT_REPLY * **How did you install Python originally?** (Official installer, package manager, etc.)
# CHAT_REPLY * **What version of Python are you currently using?** (You can check by running `python --version` or `python3 --version` in your terminal)
# CHAT_REPLY * **What version of Python do you want to upgrade to?**
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Once I have this information, I can provide you with tailored instructions on how to upgrade.
