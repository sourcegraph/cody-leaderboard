# CHAT_QUESTION how to upgrade my python version?

# CHAT_REPLY I'm sorry, but the provided code snippets are related to a Go project called "Cody Agent" and don't contain information about upgrading Python versions. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To help you upgrade your Python version, I need more context. Please tell me:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * **What is your current Python version?** (You can find this out by running `python --version` or `python3 --version` in your terminal)
# CHAT_REPLY * **What operating system are you using?** (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux)
# CHAT_REPLY * **How did you install Python in the first place?** (e.g., system package manager, official installer from python.org, Anaconda/Miniconda)
# CHAT_REPLY * **What is the specific Python version you want to upgrade to?**
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Once I have this information, I can provide you with detailed instructions on how to upgrade your Python version safely and effectively.
