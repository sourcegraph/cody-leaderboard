# CHAT_QUESTION Are you capable of upgrading my pytorch version to 1.0.0, there is a guide in the pytorch site

# CHAT_REPLY I can't help you with that. I'm an AI coding assistant and I don't have the ability to modify files or execute commands to upgrade software. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY However, I can give you some general advice on upgrading PyTorch based on the code you shared and my knowledge:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **Check for Compatibility:** Before upgrading, ensure that other libraries and dependencies in your project are compatible with PyTorch 1.0.0. The code you shared doesn't seem to have any direct dependencies on PyTorch, but it's important to check your entire project.
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **Follow the Official Guide:** The PyTorch website you mentioned likely has the most up-to-date information and instructions for upgrading. Make sure to follow their guide carefully.
# CHAT_REPLY 3. **Virtual Environments:** It's generally a good practice to use virtual environments when working with Python projects. This helps isolate dependencies and prevents conflicts between different projects.
# CHAT_REPLY 4. **Testing:** After upgrading, thoroughly test your code to ensure everything works as expected with the new PyTorch version.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you have any specific code snippets or error messages you encounter during the upgrade process, feel free to share them, and I'll do my best to assist you.
