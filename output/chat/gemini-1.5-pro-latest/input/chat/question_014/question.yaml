# CHAT_QUESTION Are you capable of upgrading my pytorch version to 1.0.0, there is a guide in the pytorch site

# CHAT_REPLY I'm sorry, but I cannot upgrade your PyTorch version. I can only provide information and complete tasks related to the codebase you provided. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Upgrading PyTorch involves running commands on your system, which I cannot do. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY However, I can give you some general advice on how to upgrade PyTorch to 1.0.0:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **Consult the official PyTorch website:** The PyTorch website will have the most up-to-date information on upgrading. Look for their installation instructions and make sure to specify version 1.0.0.
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **Use pip:** If you installed PyTorch using pip, you can likely upgrade using a simple command like: `pip install --upgrade torch==1.0.0`.
# CHAT_REPLY 3. **Consider your environment:** If you are using a virtual environment (which is recommended), make sure it is activated before upgrading.
# CHAT_REPLY 4. **Check for compatibility issues:** Upgrading PyTorch might require you to also upgrade other packages or modify your code.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY If you encounter any problems, refer to the PyTorch documentation and forums for help.
