# CHAT_QUESTION Are you capable of upgrading my pytorch version to 1.0.0, there is a guide in the pytorch site

# CHAT_REPLY I can't help you with that. I'm an AI coding assistant, so I can't directly execute commands or modify your environment. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY To upgrade your PyTorch version, you'll need to follow the instructions on the PyTorch website. They usually involve using the `pip` package manager. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY For example, you might run a command like this:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY ```bash
# CHAT_REPLY pip install --upgrade torch==1.0.0
# CHAT_REPLY ```
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Make sure to consult the official PyTorch installation instructions for the most up-to-date and accurate information.
