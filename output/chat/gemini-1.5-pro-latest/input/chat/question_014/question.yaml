# CHAT_REPLY I can certainly help guide you through upgrading your PyTorch version to 1.0.0 using the official guidelines. I can't directly modify your codebase, but I can provide you with the steps and information you need to make the upgrade. Just let me know if you have any specific questions or need assistance with any part of the process.
