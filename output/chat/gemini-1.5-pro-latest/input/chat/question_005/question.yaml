# CHAT_QUESTION what does this regex do? \n/a|e|i|o|u/\n

# CHAT_REPLY This regular expression will replace all vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in a string with nothing, effectively removing them. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Here's how it breaks down:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * `/ /`: These are the delimiters marking the start and end of the regex.
# CHAT_REPLY * `[aeiou]`: This is a character set that matches any single vowel (a, e, i, o, or u).
# CHAT_REPLY * `/ /`:  These are the delimiters again.
# CHAT_REPLY * `g`: This is a global flag, meaning the replacement will be applied to all occurrences of the pattern in the string, not just the first one.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY **Example:**
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Input string: "Hello World"
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Output after applying the regex: "Hll Wrld"
