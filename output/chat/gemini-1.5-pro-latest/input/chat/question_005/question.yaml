# CHAT_QUESTION what does this regex do? \n/a|e|i|o|u/\n

# CHAT_REPLY This regular expression finds all occurrences of the letters "a", "e", "i", "o", or "u" within a text and replaces them with nothing, essentially deleting them. The `/n` flag makes it replace all occurrences, not just the first one.
