# CHAT_QUESTION what does this regex do? \n/a|e|i|o|u/\n

# CHAT_REPLY This regex removes vowels (a, e, i, o, u) from any given text. 
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY Here's how it works:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY * `/ /`: These are the delimiters marking the start and end of the regex.
# CHAT_REPLY * `[aeiou]`: This is a character set that matches any single vowel (a, e, i, o, or u).
# CHAT_REPLY * `/g`: This is a global flag that tells the regex to replace all occurrences of the matched pattern, not just the first one.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY So, when this regex is applied to a string, it will find all lowercase vowels and replace them with nothing, effectively deleting them from the string.
