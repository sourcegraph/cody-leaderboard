# CHAT_QUESTION What all different CodeSearch services are being used by Cody context?

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided codebase context, Cody uses several different CodeSearch services for context:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. Remote Search: There's a `RemoteSearch` class that implements `ContextStatusProvider` and `IRemoteSearch`. This allows Cody to search remote repositories for context.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. Local Keyword Search: Support for local keyword search is mentioned in the changelog, particularly for Windows.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. Embeddings Search: The changelog mentions handling of embeddings search backward compatibility, indicating that embeddings are used for context search.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. Natural Language Search: There's a mention of "Cody Natural Language Search (Beta)" in one of the README files, suggesting this is another method used for finding context.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. Context Ranking: There's a `context-ranking.ts` file that seems to provide a service for ranking context items.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 6. File Path Search: The code mentions searching for file paths, which is another way to gather context.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 7. Directory Search: There's a function `getContextFileFromDirectory` suggesting Cody can search directories for context.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 8. Open Tabs Search: The function `getContextFileFromTabs` indicates Cody can gather context from currently open editor tabs.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY These various search methods allow Cody to gather comprehensive context from different sources, both local and remote, to provide more accurate and relevant assistance.
