# CHAT_QUESTION What different context ranking logics are implemented in Cody?

# CHAT_REPLY Cody implements several context ranking logics:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. Chat-based context ranking: This uses a chat model to rank context items based on their relevance to the query.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. Embedding-based context retrieval: This uses embedding models to find relevant context based on semantic similarity.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. Feature-based ranking: The `computeFeatures` method suggests there's a feature-based approach to context ranking.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. Model-specific embeddings: The `searchModelSpecificEmbeddings` method uses specific embedding models like "sentence-transformers/multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1" for context retrieval.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. Experimental chat context ranker: There's a configuration option for an experimental chat context ranker.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 6. Local file system-based ranking: The code includes logic to work with local file paths and repositories.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 7. Customizable ranking: The system allows for custom instructions to be added to chat and edit commands, which can influence context ranking.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY These different approaches allow Cody to provide flexible and effective context ranking for various use cases and environments.
