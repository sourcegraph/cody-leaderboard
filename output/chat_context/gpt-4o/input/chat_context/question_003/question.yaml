# CHAT_QUESTION What all different CodeSearch services are being used by Cody context?

# CHAT_REPLY Based on the provided codebase context, Cody uses several different CodeSearch services:
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 1. **Local Search**: 
# CHAT_REPLY    - Cody builds a search index of your local files to facilitate natural language queries. This is mentioned in the `README.md` file under the section "Cody Natural Language Search (Beta)".
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 2. **Remote Search**: 
# CHAT_REPLY    - Cody Enterprise retrieves context from the entire remote codebase using Sourcegraph search. This allows Cody to understand and answer questions about all of your code, including repositories that are not on your local machine. This is mentioned in the `README.md` file under the section "Cody Enterprise".
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 3. **Contextual Search within the Codebase**:
# CHAT_REPLY    - Cody can gather context from the entire repository to provide more accurate answers and generate idiomatic code. This includes finding specific components, understanding how frontend data is populated in a React app, etc. This is mentioned in the `README.md` file under the section "Code Graph".
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 4. **Enhanced Context**:
# CHAT_REPLY    - Cody can use enhanced repository-wide code context by enabling "Enhanced Context" and tagging specific files and symbols. This is mentioned in the `chat.md` file under the section "Chat".
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 5. **Feature Flags for Contextual Features**:
# CHAT_REPLY    - Various feature flags are used to enable or disable specific contextual features, such as `cody-url-context`, `cody-hover-commands`, and `cody-chat-context-budget`. These are defined in the `FeatureFlagProvider.ts` file.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 6. **Code Lenses for Contextual Commands**:
# CHAT_REPLY    - Cody adds code lenses to the current file for quick access to Cody commands. This is configured in the `package.json` file with the setting `cody.commandCodeLenses`.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 7. **Remote Search Implementation**:
# CHAT_REPLY    - The `RemoteSearch` class in `remote-search.ts` provides methods to set repositories, query them, and search for context items within them.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY 8. **Enterprise Context Factory**:
# CHAT_REPLY    - The `enterprise-context-factory.ts` file mentions the creation of `RemoteSearch` instances, indicating the use of remote search capabilities in an enterprise context.
# CHAT_REPLY 
# CHAT_REPLY These services collectively enable Cody to provide comprehensive code search and contextual understanding capabilities, both locally and remotely.
